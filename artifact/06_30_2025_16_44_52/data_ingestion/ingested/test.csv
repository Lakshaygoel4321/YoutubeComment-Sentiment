interesting point that better equipment tends have better photos because used more experienced photographers never actually come across that point before the end the day good photo made good composition doesn matter the focus bit soft you have some vignetting because you used cheap lens you have bit too much iso noise because you using cheaper smaller sensor these are technical aspects which can make the difference between good and great photo this where people seem get hung arguing about technical details like corner sharpness particular lens about battery life dual card slots doesn matter you have dual card slots you can take good photo you just saving shit photo cards now good battery just allows you take more bad photos doesn matter how sharp the corners are not good photo like the argument about sony not releasing lens today there are photos out there that are good because they were shot good photo shot will still look good was shot just possibly not quite good not trying say here that narrow dof and bokeh makes good photo fact that brings common pitfall that many beginners fall into they get fast lens usually fast 50mm 85mm and shoot everything wide open they paid all this money get fast aperture after all would waste not use course there are few situations where equipment makes the photo for instance macro photography super telephotos for wildlife photography although there are lot good wildlife photos taken using spotting scopes instead proper telephotos ,1

brilliant point point breakdown one other argument making the rounds false argument okay maybe the strikes took place but should have been kept secret and deniable there good reason for dgmo make statements about covert actions except for bjp score political points there are massive number reasons make strike like this public exposes pakistan bluster just tough talk for all their talk being high alert for indian troop movement along the loc after the uri attack they didn even see coming massively boosts morale within the armed forces morale which has been getting steadily lower our bases kept getting hit while they were not allowed take charge the offensive the troops are also being vilified the media national and international while trying control spiral violence srinagar fueled pakistan propaganda machine makes the best use pakistan blunder overreaching and outmaneuvers them pakistan has its hands tied now after making bold statements about defending against indian adventurism aggression and denying that any terrorist camps even exist the region that they have the support their government pakistan has left itself publicly admissible out can either promise retaliation for strikes thereby confirming the existence such terror bases deny the strike and claim ignorance any bases the area releasing statements and evidence the strikes india makes pakistan look weak and incompetent defense while also making the point that pakistan harbors terrorists and uses them proxy war against india manner that exceeds just providing moral and diplomatic support they have claimed the past calls pakistan bluff threats start nuclear conflict their nuclear arsenal while still being very real and implicit threat longer their impenetrable shield striking within pok and then making public india has taken control the escalatory ladden you said earlier out the open for everyone see which leads the next point makes public the strategic shift indian policy dealing with cross border infiltration and terrorism this now means that india controls the play events and that infiltration will actively fought against taking the fight the terror outposts and leaving open the possibility even striking training camps situated further inland this means that india will make pakistan work and pay for every infiltration attempt literally not just pay terms revenge and bloodshed pakistan will need actually spend more time money resources manpower actual defense and surveillance near these bases their terror outposts will have constantly vigilant and more resources dedicated keeping eye out for incoming strikes the future this very different from the past where the outposts had nothing worry about till they crossed the border and their entire focus was offensive not defensive nature points out very little fencing the pakistani side because they never even felt the need defend themselves but that will all change now terrorists will not sleep peacefully their beds they will possibly make more mistakes and every new person recruited keep watch patrol their perimeter potential vulnerability too accidentally leaked info paid informant mole many these will make increasingly expensive and difficult maintain multiple such bases leading demoralized terrorists demoralized pakistani troops demoralized and disillusioned pakistani public pakistan currently damage control mode firing off more propaganda than artillery and trying pooh pooh the stories the strikes indian propaganda but inaccuracies their accounts will begin add and morale will definitely take hit everyone the pakistani side currently denial but that expected ultimately again makes the government look dishonest incompetent and erodes their imaginary moral high ground that they lay claim strengthens the indian public support for the government this definitely well deserved win for the bjp but more importantly makes the indian public lot more unified behind their central government regardless who was power when such action was taken there are certainly plenty who question the narrative and events but there definite surge public approval favor retaliation for uri and the strikes themselves regardless their position the who how where why covert overt bragging courting war etc this demonstrates among other things that the goi proactive that was receptive the outrage about uri across the nation that was willing take stand such attacks indian sovereignty demonstrates india ability operate within the bounds previous agreements and treaties while still taking decisive action defend itself and not being enslaved those treaties pakistan has always played victim when came any border related issue and deny any involvement previous incursions from their side meanwhile india hamstrung restrictive treaties preventing military retaliation for numerous actions carried out pakistan and its proxy fighters till now this deft navigation not altering the loc while striking terrorist camps falls well within the bounds the simla agreement and the charter surgical strikes across loc line with shimla agreement and charter 3026586 html exploring this avenue publicly means that india can now freely continue perform such strikes the future without invoking any backlash from most other nations and getting active support from several now let assume that the strikes took place but the government kept absolutely secret the outcome not making the strikes public knowledge would have been quite disadvantageous the whole india maintains deniability for aggressive action great but pakistan will constantly play the victim anyway portray cross border terrorism domestic rebellion foment unrest and paint india oppressive bully state committing atrocities kashmir very little advantage here while the strike killed handful terrorists and prevented few attacks the near future would fail adequately capitalize that victory other terror outfits and individual members such organisations may remain unaware and unafraid pakistani turf terrorists sleeping soundly before attempting border crossing isn good for indian defense maintaining state combat ready vigilance and tension impossible for more than few days for all but the most highly trained soldiers demoralizes indian troops they would feel abandoned the govt and the people left deal with bloodthirsty militants all themselves without any chance take action and preempt such attacks the indian soldiers continue the only ones who sleep fear with the fatigue constant vigilance making them weaker while the enemy gets stronger indian silence taken for weakness emboldens our enemies india seen soft target home and abroad india loses control the narrative the few who would aware the covert action the other side could later alter the narrative they have done several times the past and claim india committed atrocities and crimes pakistani territory and killed civilians blaming raw and other agencies and using justify further attacks several years the future the context and events this time would have faded from the public mind and india would the diplomatic back foot having either deny the action ever took place and look guilty forced justify such action and remind the public that was retaliation for uri not random unprovoked attack better claim upfront and connect the two events inextricably forever india retaliates for uri massacre today lot better than india denies committing war crimes pok years later when the conspiracy theorists would have had plenty time concoct alternate narrative pakistan would continue have the facade nuclear shield despite successful strike until challenged head publicly pakistan claims would continue hold weight pakistan retains control the escalatory ladder pakistan bluff not called and continues project the image competent military pakistan retains the facade harboring terrorists its soil what terrorists public acknowledgement

upa was good maybe even marginally better upa was jackshit not only the second upa era gave rise numerous scams but also made sloth the economy raised our corruption perception worldwide and general brought much trouble which effected middle class like directly remember inflation rates remember new scam unearthing every month those things are history atleast for now for common man much hate corruption effects him more than communal tensions you may have communal incident once week once month but crime statistics wise they are miniscule not justifying supporting any communal activity here inflation and corruption directly effects people you will need interact with some govt official sometime your life you well need buy commodities and food survive communal incidents are rather unfortunate events which can avoided and controlled want other issues that people raise here gst bullet train aadhar rera jan dhan cashless etc people need realise that these are the steps need take sooner later order develop any nation needs have single national tax instead madrid taxes any nation big india needs single citizen identity any nation needs have real estate regulated any nation big india needs faster and hassle free transport need bring poor people banking finance give them financial benefits need find ways use cashless methods for hassle free economic activities you want improve them fight for their right implementation not the ideas make the govt responsible for aadhaar privacy find solutions make gst filing hassle free see how you can have regulated real estate that beneficial both home buyers and builders the above idea can extended demonitisation too much want many people are not ready believe that modi carried out demonitisation for his own personal benefits that doesn sell his stature the eyes the people are even higher than that was botched execution many people agree with that but not that his intent was wrong then there are issues that are handled well foreign relations for example now people can dismiss india diplomatic victory over china chest thumping and hypernationalism for bhakts but today world incidents like these effect economics well are not pushover nation anymore can guard our interests well this also gives rise economics perception and more and investments thus lifting more people out poverty ,1

one the best prayers dedicate the merit you can find different versions you google “dedication merit” however you can also say your own version out loud the end your meditation session you can make spontaneously you want the idea that any benefit virtuous actions like meditation practice easily dissipated you keep the “merit” for yourself like giving money charity — you public way make people admire you — cheapens the act and makes less powerful you may get some immediate compliments and benefits but these are quickly used like the virtuous act drop water the desert — easily dries dedicating the merit you generate the thought and wish that any benefit from your virtuous action any joy enhanced reputation monetary reward spiritual development any other positive result will experienced others much more than yourself this way your virtuous action like taking drop water and putting the ocean — will never dry until the end time the end your practice session just say “may this not for alone learn patience deal with anger may others benefit and learn from actions experience joy may others share may others come contact with any capacity benefit cruel them may they cultivate compassion for generous them may give them the means generous others ” you can make your own more traditional recitation “ this merit may all obtain omniscience may defeat the enemy wrongdoing from the stormy waves birth old age sickness and death from the ocean samsara may free all beings ” ,1

 became interested indian politics during the cwg and iac fiasco used think bjp was good option for india even brought into their diatribe against minority appeasement when first became moderator india people did complain about adding bjp supporter sample some statements from around that time problem was with the fact that most india likes term each and every action bjp anti minority and cultivate bias based that point that one should look the issue hand anna protest was vilified because perceived backing the rss that opinion was bogus reason being thrown around congress tomorrow bjp calls for uniform civil law would support however they start limiting rights for non hindus would call them out for and oppose them tooth and nail when was countered with facts and sources was forced reconsider went through the works golwalkar and savarkar and realised that was ill informed and was morally repugnant support ideology that preached the prominence single religion the indian state for congress hold them responsible for most the ills plaguing this country they are the ones who have governed for the maximum amount time and they have ruined quite well actually believe that they have hindered secularism our country rather than help their appeasement select minorities their reservation policies their petty vote bank politics has created divides where none existed top all there rahul gandhi good for nothing fellow whose only claim fame his last name was unaware the difficulties that india had when became independent and didn appreciate the challenges that the young nation faced have now come respect nehru for the strength our democratic and educational institutions and regard him the best that india has had and one the best pms that any new republic has had for rahul gandhi while definitely not bright lad now realise how easy sound smart when you are the opposition least rahul gandhi not religious fundamentalist like modi ,1

let just begin making two caveats don support modi today and think demonetisation was disaster and voted for him 2014 and don regret would have done again even with hindsight that because upa was corrupt fuck and needed taught lesson having said that think you are buying for the hype that individual pms matter more than they actually see policy nation continuum indian reforms actually began the early 1980s not 1991 just that the crisis the early 1990s meant that you could stuff politically which were impossible before people confuse externally induced event with internal reform failing understand that this was fact the overall direction before well the same applies modi you actually look the policies his administration has pursued has largely stuck the status quo result there are good reasons for this the last years the top countries terms growth have been china india and vietnam that order the burger say why fix something that ain broken demonetisation was disaster yes but will short lived one the slowdown the indian economy actually began 2011 and fully manifested itself year later since then gfcf has steadily decline the savings rate has declined the npas have increased and exports have been subdued these are all contingent many factors many whom are global nature and which are not really the ambit control any indian think modi has been dealing with these issues suboptimal way has been slow deal with the npas made near impossible for rajan continue refused defend him the face bigoted attacks many his schemes are just rebrands such make india without much new thought but point being don buy your argument that singh was superstar and modi disaster modi had been elected 2004 and was able ride the global wave growth would having the same growth numbers singh presided over also say what you will but large scale corruption far less today than was upa possible that second term with modi would change that upa had far fewer scams but far can only judge what have and thus far there have been fewer scams ,1

this the reasoning have mind regarding post godhra riots modi did indeed order the genocide and protect the perpetrators did not order the genocide but actively allowed happen and protected the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop but couldn however after the incidents defended the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop the best his ability but couldn actively pursued many convictions possible after the incidents and are brainers there should doubt anyone mind that such person should not become the also not positive because the fact remains that could not stop people from dying with whatever control had but indeed true would give him the benefit the doubt because his track record wrt development since the riots but the unapologetic tone disrespect towards the media aggressive rss support convince that very unlikely that true hence modi not the right person lead the country especially with many other able leaders found even within the bjp edit grammar,1

politicians are usually very subtle about how they about moulding public opinion these days more blatant but then partisanship has also increased you look how they pushed through regulations and how they are eroding our fundamental rights scary thing the supreme court recently said that the fundamental freedoms are not absolute and the state can take away this the most alarming thing that have ever heard this means that they can challenge and even end the freedom religion press speech assembly against exploitation etc the core values our nation and constitution was based this could mean that religion becomes part the government and politics not good mix theocracies are the least free countries out there and the most regressive the problem with the current government how they are using rhetoric divide the country more than anything else they called entire universities anti national they doctored videos show student leaders bad light they made people stand for national anthems theaters enforcement being infringement our rights too used the political machinery stifle dalit voices attacked the patriotism everyone who opposed them used the armed forces political tool shamed people for complaining about being unable access their hard earned money because poor government policy invoking soldiers two their states have passed strict conversion laws tried incite violence kerala among other states passed beef ban creating aura fear encouraged vigilantism thereby undermining the power police and judiciary pretty much endorsing bullying coercion and fearmongering have insulted and harassed and villified intellectuals scientists reformists rationalists journalists and activists thereby stifling free speech and also causing harm the ones exercising the problem not just doing these things but also forming public opinion that these are the right things making people themselves forgo their fundamental rights unknowingly this erodes the constitution and our democratic framework and dangerous for the nation this how fascist and authoritarian states like franco spain mussolini italy and ergodan turkey trump america and putin russia were formed not desirable outcome ,-1

 didn vote for bjp either but was all ready vote for them 2019 because realized any government will need ten years show changes unlike feel statements like this country fucked over reaction yes have had quite few headline grabbing events the past one month but none them barring the haryana incident perhaps affected anything more than the population there whole wide world outside what the media covers and things are improving there but agree where coming from and truly pissed the way the government has been derailing its own mandate reforms our country are such low hanging fruit that the government could have done nothing but the bare minimum technology deployments and they would have been back power 2019 now not really sure have never ever felt such viciousness from any party its supporters was not alive during indira gandhi tenure would any day take scam over almost the entire population feeling victimized brain washed one way the other ready for third front 2019 true reforms will much slower but india has grown earlier when the government was auto pilot can continue run that way instead risking civil war something ,1

there couple reasons see for this though have been struggling formulate them into something coherent generally speaking long periods time dominated one side often results resurgence the other and that has been part but genuinely believe that specifically the right there growing population secular guess libertarians for lack better word the traditional right which was the dominant sector republicans shrinking the day and the next generation republicans aren going anything like the last gone are the days when gay marriage and religion were one the primary issues the right while issues like guns and migration will still primary issues the party expect see republicans whole become drastically more secular and oriented around nationalism and limited government rather than religion europe thats already happened quite while ago fact many places europe their parties are more far left and moderate left rather then the more traditional left wing right wing parties true right wing doesn exactly exist anymore europe atleast not large scale though europe there has been resurgence and based biased opinion people were tired political correctness persay they were tired the regulations the migration and often limited speech afd got relatively low numbers germany but they are growing quickly and very well could become primary party marie pen very nearly won and trump did the left the and the overall popularity right wing politics once again growing marie pen afd and donald trump are right wing but its not the fact that their right wing that causing resurgence think better call these parties nationalist people want their country put first again they want their sovereignty held above anything else not migrants not the their country donald trump campaign ran nationalism and putting the usa first things like migration nationalism and potentially free speech are going key issues for right wing parties and this the primary reason that right wing parties are beginning come back people were largely turned off the religious zeal the 90s gop while now still predominantly conservative this conservatism very much orientated around economics and migration rather than religion which has the potential draw people who were otherwise the fence and lot more appealing the average person ,1

 agree the should not have wear his patriotism sleeve same for all muslims the country there are some bad apples but there are many others that don side with the stupid fanatics similarly modi doesnt have come out every single time and admonish idiots who are radical hindu rss side for even though wish did because considering the questions his past and his standing the leader has coming out and saying this not right but imo simplying tad bit let call spade spade there lot shit that goes the muslim side muslim law board and lack ucc come dude that effed either are secular state are not shout out for goa the only state the union india with uniform civil code there doubt bias india against muslims unfortunate but exists and that manifests itself many ways how people interact with muslims etc sometimes feels like vicious cycle speaking folks the courts and the prisons not problem that limited muslims alone somewhat factor the messed judicial system draw parallel with caucasians and african americans the there inherent bias based what have read against african americans and there might something similar indian setups definitely worth looking into but would look for some data making sweeping statements makes you somewhat guilty even discounting your rant tone speaking like the idiots you rightly ridiculing ,-1

first all there was never and there hard line that divides muslims india from muslims outside and there was any chance that post 1947 pakistan creation killed trying limit muslims india does not make sense fact what will make sense see muslim behaviour when they are majority and contrast with when they are minority why think that islam its current form problem humans long for model live life and one that assuages natural fears death religions try and that and communism imo faded despite its formidable showing the last century because had answers what happens beyond death but perfect religion needs explain human nature well enough quell scepticism from the most thoughtful sceptic the more enquiring person terms philosophy the harder sell religion with only rituals pray five times day for example observation islam oversimplifies everything makes very convenient not think and not question when zealot observes that people are not how the world should his and almost always first instinct change whether acts not woman not being modest cover her someone bowing idol smash and good analogy the gun control argument that rages the united states proponents unrestricted gun ownership point out that gun instrument and only the person who judges whether use not and that the instrument cannot blamed similarly metaltemujin wrote this let not talk about what the quran says doesn say talk about how muslims behave regardless are not talking religion only action and interaction but going the gun analogy guns make lot easier similarly islam opinion makes lot easier for person extremist skill thinking other areas does not immunise the person since are dealing with axioms that people don naturally question they don question because religious models the world are specifically address deep fears mortality and existential fear plus course most have education philosophy any discussion what your problem with muslims the quran and the hadiths need part ,1

this comment had posted earlier cents will try explain why think lost people seem quick criticize modi for communal problems india was born and brought mangalore communal tension common there every year used have school shutdown for few days and bajrang dal was and very strong there some small things like muslim boy marrying hindu girl hindu boy marrying muslim girl would tick people off from both sides and shit would escalate out control was from hindu brahmin family and even was afraid bajrang dal when modi came power there was massive rally these nutcase hindu groups many school friends participated this rally unfortunately and people this rally were openly saying things like now you wait and see what happens muslim neighborhoods they all think their time has come they all feel they won touched and that they have the pms support that why they have become extra bold modi responds strongly one incident against right wing just once come out openly and say something throw some these people jail these people will know not with their shit but unfortunately central government hasn done that both sides treat them both equally and throw people from both sides jail that even better but modi needs take strong stance against religious intolerance from both sides not the rise intolerance that the problem the fact that most these extreme right wing crazies think they have centers support and take center silence yes have seen and talked many bajrang dal mangalore and they truly believe and the other communities think they are under attack and also think the center supports the right wing sure center doesn support either side but silence not helping one clear and loud message from modi condemning both sides and rss etc for this will get everyone confidence back that edit lots comments cannot individually reply but some clarification not saying modi responsible not saying has apologize for every incident that crazy and unfair cant hold one person accountable for billion people that humanely not possible but because lot right wing crazies think modi supports them modi comes out and clarifies once and for all people will calm down right wing will know they dont have the support support dont mean legal support states duty many said and the minorities will stop crying that supports them someone below mentioned about discrimination against black community the example when black people went rampage obama did make statement that was not for black people riot like the way they were many people thought obama was support blacklivesmatter because black too but came out and said understands their frustration but was dead against their method showing that frustration actually came out and acknowledged the shitty behavior minority was doing even though black community hardcore supporters his own democratic party just modi coming out and openly criticizing these right wing actions will calm things down certain extent ,1

 was congress very late the social media game since 2014 bjp currently enjoys enormous dominance over social media narrative right now this changing how are you trying change how you plan combat the religious far right narrative social media bjp social media driven mostly either relgious far right hatred modi personality beyond social media how you plan combat hate politics rahul gandhi image has been painted succesfully bjp enormously negative and incompetent even not based reality how are you guys managing combat that for example rahul made many speeches many think tanks those speeches are not spread lot the social media team like this one found this chance when was searching for specific speeches and topics this hasn been publicized lot nationalism you think congress leaders should talk agressively pakistani deep state sponsorship terror know the views manish tewari surjewala because searched the statements their leaders but problem visibility this should repeated again and again their statements are not getting enough limelight nationalism rahul gandhi has indeed praised the iaf strikes and others which the positive step but after that the fog war bjp makes unsubtantiated statement 400 dead random congress leaders questions bjp brands you anti national equating questioning this questioning the indian air force bjp indeed dangerously politicizing the airstrikes but congress falling into the trap taking their bait seems congress falling into the bait bjp most common people not really care about minute details spice 2000 spice 250 most people don care the narrative what congress losing domestic politics international media doesn fight elections here what you think omar abdullah advice the opposition the more you talk about economy and jobs less you have talk about anti national national the opposition parties need switch tracks deny the the space politicise the recent terror attack air strikes the way keep the messaging focused the economy rural distress unemployment agriculture all the other things bjp doesn’ want discussed every time talk about pulwama balakote leave the door wide open for the the bjp play their strengths front their home audience logic would dictate switch strategies make them play our strengths now here another article omar retweeted which says modi has failed many issues but winning the narrative falling into every trap modi setting for them 2004013 some food for thought what you think the ideal way approach this congress willing shift tracks omar put the mahagatbandhan what congress strategy creating narrative for the party the opposition here seems bjp tying more alliances from shiv sena aiadmk for simply boils down two things either there prepoll alliance there not there will come under upa there not then possible that there will post poll alliance then why the need campaign together and the same stage you don put common candidate from each constituency the opposition mega rallies seem only benefit non congress parties the called mahaghatbandan the grand alliance really that much different from nda upa can congress clarify approach alliances modi creating simply narrative you are with you are with khichdi what congress simple message 2014 and rethinking rahul gandhi had said that congress leaders had gotten arrogant the end years upa which was one cause the downfall congress how does the congress message look back upa you say openly you made mistakes but the party has moved improved itself introspected the faults have you thought new name for alliance you win like replacement upa mark symbolic new beginning twitter there lot hate speech and fake news twitter bjp parlimaentary leaders summoned jack dorsey after twitter india suspended hate speech peddler squintneon abvp member from assam who posted posts mocking and celebrating the death dalit student rohith vermula his account was then promoted smiti irani twitter panelists are invited will congress able highlight the core cause this twitter hoopla bigot from abvp mocking suicide and being supported smiriti irani congress should publicize this direct support for this man parliament should also ask about twitter handling rampant fake news and hate speech twitter bjp again created the narrative jack dorsey snubs india based this one temperoriliy deletion hate speech supporter congress should highlight this incident bjp trying appropriate ambedkar and talk dailt rights but leaders are supporting such hatemongerers but twitter narrative jack dorsey who personally doesn know much sweeping this under the rug that know very long questions but these are important topics and congress would benefit from this discussion takes the right lessons ,1

part you have something mind please let know canadian born and raised punjabi sikh university student working through the sustainable agriculture program have few other western born punjabi sikh friends the program well most have decided that after graduation will punjab work with higher education institutes ngo and other grassroots organizations promote sustainable organic methods agriculture among farmers punjab firmly believe that reversing the damage the 20th century green revolution absolutely necessary pulling punjab out its current dire situation only returning indigenous sustainable methods farming can punjab future food security protected modern yet sustainable methods agriculture would increase yield protect soil fertility water levels and stop poisoning ground water addition the above points sustainable agriculture virtue being more human labor intensive would easily open whole new world job opportunities for these unemployed punjabi youths who turn drugs because they can find jobs sustainable agriculture would also wonders for women rights punjab this system just does not work without female participation and empowerment one the biggest issues punjab today that the husband father brother son dies killed the women the family are plunged into poverty simply starve death because they don have the means provide for the family themselves but because women are arguably even more important for the success sustainable agriculture than men and play huge role making work provides women widows and single family households the financial security necessary feed themselves pay the rent and educate the children even the unfortunate case where the primary male breadwinner gone for more that please see these short videos z4ws9emhve4 awfrpx slua top securing punjab future ecological security and food security protecting the water our homeland providing young punjabis the means escape unemployment and empowering women perhaps sustainable agriculture greatest benefit that unified community effort builds strong communities strong neighborhoods and strong families everybody comes together make success the historical success punjab has largely lied the ability communities stand together against whatever oppression they were facing humans are social creatures despite being the richest most privileged group the history humanity

agriculture not only makes 21st century nations food secure but builds community strength and brings people together jrz34dee7xy local sustainable urban food systems could have even greater effect the land five rivers but the most exciting thing about all this that isn just confined the realm theory hopeful thinking there are people punjab who are following the sustainable path punjab today and reaping huge rewards for one such person the the organic farmer anandpur darshan singh rudel french born british national who finally decided make home punjab and converted sikhi darshan singh totally believes the idea and spirit organic food does his better half but when they bought the land nurpur bedi family and friends actively discouraged them from the organic idea everyone agreed wouldn work out remembers wryly but believed and went ahead question principles says the farmer produce healthy food and consumption organic food leads well ourished body the farm which has undergone whirlwind change since darshan took work looks transported from another country altogether the landscaping effect beams darshan singh punjab farmers have change their farming concept that don’ want end with barren land our outlet here town have regular clientele and the number only increasing declares the rather reticent malwinder kaur who takes care the marketing aspect the farm but darshan singh rues governmental attitude the government does nothing for the few who are trying revive the fertility the soil fumes obviously there are people punjab already who are reviving the organic sustainable methods which have worked for thousands upon thousands years and they doing successfully think the best way convince people sustainable practices implement them successfully ourselves and people like darshan singh are living examples what possible when you put your heart and mind into the practice forget about two birds killing multiple birds all with one stone ultimately sustainable agriculture practices are something the punjabi people need start taking seriously again there seems very negative attitude our community towards agriculture like something only uneducated people would this needs change are ever save punjab from the dire situation think the reason that for the vast majority our parents grandparents did agriculture and they themselves are the ones who are pushing away from remember growing and hearing from father over and over again that the dream hurry and finish school get job accountant manager top bank the country sit air conditioned office clean environment and work for the hours and then home the wife and kids and that this what would make happy listened father and enrolled accounting university last year and dropped the class after month knew wasn for and despite what father may think not everyone wants sit around office doing paperwork all day now looking forward finishing sustainable agriculture degree and leaving work punjab with like minded people there someone out there reading this post who wants make difference punjab protect our ecology make punjab and hopefully set example for the rest india and the world food secure help end farmer suicide getting them out debt empower women widows and single family homes stop the use toxic chemicals which are poisoning our groundwater and causing rampant cancer among the punjabi population give unemployed youth life line get off the streets put down the drugs and bew able earn proper living for themselves and their families protect our diminishing water levels unite community living and strong families and transform punjab into one the most fertile regions the world then please note that never too late get involved this line work long you have the passion and plan intelligently you will succeed agriculture one field which will never stop being relevant there are people their late and the program university you want you can ,1

 working theory that one single thing responsible but the recipe the world perfect for the rise fascism globalization has driven mass global immigration which turn has resulted anti immigrant backlash globally this combined with growing wealth inequality gap and with the left most places embracing corporate interests rather than punishing rampant corporate malfeasance has all fed into rising discontent among those who are feeling these effects most trades and low skill workers are seeing more and more immigrants around them their paychecks are covering less and less and those with any power wealth are continuing accrue more while the the progressive parties the world typically known for representing the working class the exception here but the result the same because they have embraced big business the expense the working class thus people are unhappy with the current global model they feel forgotten the left this leaves huge vacuum for populist support which can capitalize peoples anger and fear powerful emotions that are the hallmarks authoritarianism ,1

seeing lot confusion about the concept trends wins and what they constitute try and explain short since early the morning the officials start counting votes from each evm don know how many they count from once but they need lots rounds count them all and meanwhile the votes that have already been counted are displayed which are known trends the trends show which party ahead others particular constituency which why more votes are counted the party with the most votes that constituency can change does lot times what are seeing this time news channels are the number seats each party has the highest number votes far these can change more votes are counted sooner later the officials will done with all the rounds constituencies and then news channels will also show how many seats each party has won the number won seats which determine whether party has majority assembly not and then further horse trading after results are out course why they show trends they don matter the end not entirely sure either think combination trying keep transparency while counting votes not sure about this particular and news channels having half day broadcasting material that the political equivalent badminton match where the viewer glued see the shuttlecock jump from one court another you have any questions glad answer able ,1

this what people who compare modi 2014 campaign with trump campaign fail realise trump campaigned platform explicit xenophobia racism and sexism didn hide anything about and that why most likely will win again because there was little scope losing hope him for his base modi was different him and his party history aside his campaign was the back huge anti incumbency against congress upa and modi came promising jobs and development and better standard living excluding minor dog whistling never ran hindutva candidate ever and big portion the who voted for him did because they wanted corruption free government that worked for the people the youth wanted jobs and controlled inflation prices the farmers wanted respectable wage for their year long hard work and what did modi let the hindutva crazies run loose and they started killing muslims and lynching dalits for their cow slaughter did the great leader much open his mouth the right time nope when did condemn those people was either too late too meek and each time the sangh parivar fired back that had disappointed them ended erecting government show and drama government theater which lacked any substance there many things could have done with majority everywhere except the rajya sabha but did not people are sick nehru and the congress being blamed for everything sick his lies sick his narcissism sick his refusal even acknowledge the negative aspects demonetisation sick him and his ministers trying brow beat every government organisation into submission people are absolutely disillusioned totally feel like 2019 going huge shock modi and vajpayee had good government and was far better leader and still lost 2004 don surprised this pompous ass and his team arrogant assholes lose again least will forced form minority government 2019 here hoping for good days ,-1
 like the ideas you have your theory but you making lot big assumptions based little info especially about the roman pantheon because have idea how much time has passed there will even romans the god war universe the god death part your theory good but that was the case kratos would god multiple things since killed most the gods the greek pantheon think the reason that kratos will able affect ragnarok because time travel will used there already evidence time travel throughout the story the walls jotunheim and the story thor knocking the world serpent into the past know that kratos has used time travel before god war and the fates help him against the greek gods with the hints the story gives about time travel think very likely that will use again against the norse gods atreus will when becomes loki think this plays nicely into the theory floating around about kratos being tyr with the evidence being that the final mural jotunheim shows kratos missing his right hand which tyr also missing the original mythos the game based there are lot holes the kratos tyr theory such baldur freya and the other gods not recognizing kratos tyr since they had met tyr before kratos but think time travel will help explain those plot holes and this the direction the series will that kratos can pantheons other cultures tyr and fight their gods ,1

until there not much big change think modi better option than rahul kejriwal mulayam mamta nitish need stable govt rather than circus congress make some big change top leadership than might think about that there are demonetization aadhar privacy and cow intolerance related issues which may increase negative mindset about modi but think aadhar privacy and intolerance not the big issue the eyes common man people will forget demonetization 2019 there still bright chance modi win election stop making more mistakes ,1

see every religion old and archaic but some points which trouble are follows not generalising the community the religion terrorists belonging lashkar toiba and hizbul mujahideen get mass funerals attended thousands people terrorist who was gunned down the security forces the valley received gun salute from fellow militants midst mourners these mourners were ordinary villagers who had come mourn the death terrorist belonging group coordinating with qaeda support for yakub memon this something which rankled the core was still bearable for burhan wani get support because was phenomenon one extremity the country but the massive amount people who gathered for yakub funeral was scary because was much further into the mainland don think that terror convict who has been hanged the supreme court for orchestrating communal bomb blasts the part the company now allied with the haqqani network deserves such funeral support for zakir naik this one uncomfortable but troubling aspect zakir naik aggressive minion who harps belittling other religions proclaim his faith superiority over the rest has advocated death for apostates support for sexual slavery and support for osama apart from being fast talking charlatan who lies pulls out fictious names out nowhere while denying evolution among host other things actually quite dangerous and has been accused inspiring the dhaka terror attackers now would certainly understand this guy were fringe but enjoys widespread popularity much that parties such the iuml and the aimim came support him focus far away international events while ignoring nearer problems home was reading wiki article the iranian election protests 2009 against alleged vote rigging the authorities support ahmadenijad today while scrolling down the article saw the various cities where protests were held most were inside iran while some were cities where there were sizeable number iranian diasporas naturalised iranian citizens but among all those cities was hyderabad too indian hyderabad don yet understand this why did some people hyderabad feel attached the elections iran that they protested against the results what are the priorities why does event quarter way across the world hold sway why similarly just don understand why there were riots azad maidan due events myanmar myanmar india ofcourse not why were there riots you see buddhist groups rioting india because they persecuted malaysia you see the hindu groups rioting because the hindus are oppressed pakistan the same way you see the christians rioting the same way because they oppressed pakistan partition this was horrific event what important that the muslim majority provinces india had muslim league governments power most the eligible voters was based limited franchise voted for the muslim league why that most the muslim voters undivided india voted for the muslim league while most the hindu voters ditched the communal hindu mahasabha vote for the congress which was largely secular this isn focused india but nevertheless have you heard the undhr its global consensus based charter basic principles focused highlighting basic human rights which should enjoyed each and every human regardless their identities its ideals are lofty and universal now have you heard the cairo declaration human rights was charter made and signed almost all members the organisation islamic countries was made opposition the unhdr which was condemned the oic members being based judeo christian values firstly ironical them oppose the unhrd because they based judeo christian values isn moses prophet islam isn jesus prophet islam why are the oic countries opposed the norms which are allegedly derived from the values which these prophets valued and practiced secondly and importantly the cairo declaration seemingly restricts the rights non muslims and declares shariat being the source law making note there other parallel cdhr nations belonging other religions such hinduism and buddhism question the whole world finds the unhdr lofty and ideal then why the muslim majority states have problem with much they were forced create restrictive alternative how you justify religious rule our history replete with muslim kings being harsh towards non muslims curtailing their rights compared muslims while the past past don understand why some these potentially divisive figures are marketed being the paragons tolerance some members the community for example aurangzeb considered mujhadid islamic reformer who saved amd rejuvenated islam some you think that figure divisive this being looked upto good guy step towards good relations ofcourse not edit why did the pew poll 2003 show majority indonesia tolerant country supporting osama confidence osama poll 2005 showed osama support pakistan the poll was held just the aftermath instead anger and resentment there was approval osama the opinions these states pakistan and indonesia dropped turned against him only after started targeting the civilians the muslim majority countries why was high the first place just because americans indians spainards and the french were attacked aren these humans just like the rest edit why are muslims states such and the the least integrated community the considered the western world christian fundamentalism citadel and yet overall going polls christians are rather marginally better terms accepting socially progressive views why that the muslim community appears the bottom the list measuring social progression everywhere you have seen this across the

typical elitist indian mindset forget modi mms this conception that only degrees from cambridge oxford harvard maybe even iit allow you think and talk strategic intellectual level might from 500 years ago but akbar was illiterate theory but reality was total military and administrative genius contemporaries who interacted with him describe him man considerable erudition who had gained merely observing others and introspection one them monserrate said and paraphrsase nobody who did not know him illiterate would consider him anything but and went away thinking was very learned and erudite closer our time and home indira gandhi who did not even pass college and yet was spectacularly competent when came politics even interacting and building bridges with world leaders though nixon and kissinger hated her abraham lincoln had little formal education and was entirely self taught man and famously called his own education defective even closer our time jayalalitha was what 10th pass for all her faults she was extremely erudite voracious reader had near eidetic memory and amazing recall facts and figures otoh you have your own mms who was used toy somebody with next educational qualifications like said this has nothing with modi mms but this arrogant attitude that deems anybody who does not have degree from fancy college brain dead could and people who were not only remarkably successful but would extremely smart and erudite despite even not having basic education why john glenn who died recently after such stellar career college dropout read churchill biography was aside from some brief flashes utterly shitty student and ironically for one the most powerful orators human history massive stutterer also like abe was pretty much self taught man this post seems inspired kejriwal tweets and the irony that someone who has decent academic record paper one the most brain dead asinine conniving assholes the indian political scene right now who talks shit and that something ,1
