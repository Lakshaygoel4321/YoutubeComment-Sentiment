 became interested indian politics during the cwg and iac fiasco used think bjp was good option for india even brought into their diatribe against minority appeasement when first became moderator india people did complain about adding bjp supporter sample some statements from around that time problem was with the fact that most india likes term each and every action bjp anti minority and cultivate bias based that point that one should look the issue hand anna protest was vilified because perceived backing the rss that opinion was bogus reason being thrown around congress tomorrow bjp calls for uniform civil law would support however they start limiting rights for non hindus would call them out for and oppose them tooth and nail when was countered with facts and sources was forced reconsider went through the works golwalkar and savarkar and realised that was ill informed and was morally repugnant support ideology that preached the prominence single religion the indian state for congress hold them responsible for most the ills plaguing this country they are the ones who have governed for the maximum amount time and they have ruined quite well actually believe that they have hindered secularism our country rather than help their appeasement select minorities their reservation policies their petty vote bank politics has created divides where none existed top all there rahul gandhi good for nothing fellow whose only claim fame his last name was unaware the difficulties that india had when became independent and didn appreciate the challenges that the young nation faced have now come respect nehru for the strength our democratic and educational institutions and regard him the best that india has had and one the best pms that any new republic has had for rahul gandhi while definitely not bright lad now realise how easy sound smart when you are the opposition least rahul gandhi not religious fundamentalist like modi ,1

 think the feeling here that they are not being heard before jaya death there was atleast feeling that there someone strong enough take our issues the center but since her death the govt seen puppet the center and its functioning only because modi help ops himself accepted this recent interview speech there sense helplessness amongst the people and that why people had come out huge numbers for jallikattu because they were sure that the govt would not anything make case for against the center have not seen this kind mobilization for protests before jaya death maybe social media contributed well but this being taken advantage ever protesting groups like seeman vaiko etc can only hope that this interim phase and would end when the next elections happen and proper govt elected having said that well deserved especially with the way modi has put state elections ahead governance ,1

first all there was never and there hard line that divides muslims india from muslims outside and there was any chance that post 1947 pakistan creation killed trying limit muslims india does not make sense fact what will make sense see muslim behaviour when they are majority and contrast with when they are minority why think that islam its current form problem humans long for model live life and one that assuages natural fears death religions try and that and communism imo faded despite its formidable showing the last century because had answers what happens beyond death but perfect religion needs explain human nature well enough quell scepticism from the most thoughtful sceptic the more enquiring person terms philosophy the harder sell religion with only rituals pray five times day for example observation islam oversimplifies everything makes very convenient not think and not question when zealot observes that people are not how the world should his and almost always first instinct change whether acts not woman not being modest cover her someone bowing idol smash and good analogy the gun control argument that rages the united states proponents unrestricted gun ownership point out that gun instrument and only the person who judges whether use not and that the instrument cannot blamed similarly metaltemujin wrote this let not talk about what the quran says doesn say talk about how muslims behave regardless are not talking religion only action and interaction but going the gun analogy guns make lot easier similarly islam opinion makes lot easier for person extremist skill thinking other areas does not immunise the person since are dealing with axioms that people don naturally question they don question because religious models the world are specifically address deep fears mortality and existential fear plus course most have education philosophy any discussion what your problem with muslims the quran and the hadiths need part ,1

inconclusive view time the best judge can really compare the post era this simplistically there was massive growth and movement the mid late because the level from which things started was low congress being historically center left party has always had socialist tendencies chose use the funds give freebies the section which was less developed vote banks etc the expense pumping that money into sectors such are infra health etc india not rich the mid india entire gdp was less than defense budget can spend use its money everything has prioritize congress choose what did only time will tell how right wrong they were when compared what comes after them current govt will also have prioritize because india while longer equal defense budget numbers still pretty poor terms its revenue can just pump money into everything and make things everywhere right that just not going happen ,1

 india pakistan html for the past few decades kashmir has largely been referred news reports and policy papers “low intensity conflict ” someone were leisurely making lamb stew but for those who call the region home means living with the constant ache our painful history despair and rage about oppressive present and uncertain future political discontent has simmered kashmir since the partition india 1947 india and pakistan which each control parts the region and claim the whole have fought three wars over india eroded the autonomy the part kashmir controlled imprisoning elected leaders and appointing puppet administrators after rigged local election 1987 kashmiris began secessionist armed uprising with support from pakistan indian military presence rose half million and the mid 1990s islamist militants from pakistan began dominate the insurgency fighting ebbed the 2000s but not before exacted high price around 000 people have been killed several hundred thousand displaced 000 more are missing since being arrested half million indian troops remain the region the 2000s kashmiris turned street protests — either peaceful armed with nothing more than stones — against the military occupation indian troops responded with bullets and more recently with pellet guns completely partially blinding hundreds protesters india and pakistan blame each other each country obsessed with proving itself better than the other but they share the responsibility for reducing kashmir ruin and destroying generations kashmiri lives the past several years the phrase often recall when think home “dying invisibly ones and twos ” every death another knife into bloodied body have been thinking about all this quite bit over the past two weeks feb suicide attack convoy indian paramilitary

tears tuesday india carried out airstrikes militant camp the balakot area northwestern pakistan — the first time indian warplanes had crossed the border since 1971 india’ top diplomats hailed the strikes wickedly obtuse language “pre emptive nonmilitary strikes” and the giddily compliant news media were told official sources that more than 300 militants had been killed security analysts india credited the airstrikes with destroying the illusion that nuclear deterrence can keep india from hitting terrorist infrastructure inside pakistan but modi’ plan didn’ intended independent reporting showed that the indian jets had hit some trees field — and not much else the next morning pakistani fighter jets dropped some bombs inside indian controlled territory which did damage restored pakistan’ national pride and showed its willingness escalate beyond indian expectations dogfight between pakistani and indian jets ensued indian plane was shot down pakistani territory and its pilot wing cmdr abhinandan varthaman was captured pakistan released video the pilot athletic man with luxurious mustache his bruised bloodied face was filmed drinking cup tea offered his captors civil and graceful conversation followed between him and his interrogator was moment filled with hint hope the indian and pakistani militaries are notorious for shredding the geneva convention bits chopping off

absolutely true there are few more things that should included when looking his appeal firstly his strongman image india and also worldwide there trend towards people who make brash provocative statements being seen strong leaders trump for instance considered his supporters stronger leader than obama though the latter actually carried out more deportations and got osama killed modi takes step further and combines with bold not necessarily good initiatives like demo and the recent air strikes against pakistan now well known that demo was complete failure and what the air strikes actually achieved terms strategic objectives unclear best but from political perspective country like india these are brilliant moves after demo people were saying idea was good only implementation was bad though implementation optional component the govt responsibilities and not the most important component course the idea itself was insane but let not there this has led the least doing something syndrome despite the fact that previous govts also have done something yet that perception has been created and modi excellent spotting this key differentiator that why the govt keeps harping about nehru and other past and dead pms that why every bjp shill keeps parroting the white lie that nothing happened years combine that with the notion that everything the has done historic even when essentially rebranded existing initiatives but his greatest trump card was and will always rahul gandhi not only because that man walking gaffe machine fair modi but modi has carefully created media network that will suppress this fact the real problem with raga and his sister they are boy scout politicians raga seems have forgotten that the three state elections were not the thumping inc victories that were expected the inc won them very narrowly all modi needed turn the tide was major national crisis modi being political genius quickly seized upon pulwama even person who intensely dislikes modi and extremely skeptical his handling pulwama cannot imagine raga handling any better than modi finally has said that the alternatives are not very promising raga shitshow mamata the next most likely candidate just fascist and authoritarian modi not more most the opposition alliances only exist beat modi that the only glue holding these rivals together should they succeed that glue will dissolve and most people know this ,1

let get this straight you educated people think modi worse than congress suppressing dissent not sure the selective amnesia genuine ignorance pretty liberal all aspects and can really answer for extreme right wingers who just like many leftists are against criticism any type and threaten violence drop hat just the top head can list these incidents which make modi look like saint even with all the allegations most them turn out bullshit sensationalism anyway only emergency and dismissal civil rights india indira forcible sterilisation poor sanjay gandhi god awful nepotism congress since 1947 which ensures that only the nehru descendent who present themselves gandhis can hold meaningful posts nurturing khalistani terrorists like bhindrawale against political opponents punjab and raid golden temple when went out control bans books artists and more they were posting anything against votebank like salman rushdie naipul bettelheim mathai numerous others even satire like kissa kursi was banned congress was serious commentary like aandhi can post whole thesis suppression free speech and how was worse and still much worse congress regimes and worse called secular party regimes like tmc and bsp not mentioning their deeds because will too long what cases are being filed one against the wire for article which presented losses negative numbers profits and claimed that politicians son got undue benefits suing someone for idiotic slander bad honestly not aware any significant state sponsored suppression anti modi anti bjp propaganda like congress and other secular political parties routinely are you talking about jaitley suing kejriwal for the sustained verbal diarrhea all for free speech but when someone starts lying and starts spreading baseless propaganda like kejru the wire ndtv all for suing them you think that suing not good action for slander crticise modi and the current regime whenever they deserve for things like bad implementation gst slow progress defence related issues and but criticism should reasonable find very annoying when people will criticise modi for wholly stupid things like their house getting flooded with water murder journalists like gauri shankar both congress states over the top actions called cow vigilantes some random remote location and far social media concerned even the comparatively sophisticated educated liberal supporters congress aap and other parties are much worse than most rabid right wingers just take look twitter time lines people like tehseen bainjal alka lamba ram subraniam ankit lal abhishek mishra amaresh misra and numerous others follow them and they never fail worse than most lumpen right wingers wouldn touch with feet pole there are morons each side but bjp side for better for india and ideals atheist patriotic liberal citizen know that there are lot edgy teenagers here who think that nobody apart from people like them who follow supposedly liberal ideology mostly cut and paste template from other countries can have any reasonable opinion but here you either accept that there are different shades right wing and modi supporters and that the called liberals are very often just spreading fake outrage propaganda ,-1

war mongering the easiest way out following horrific attack the kind which happened pulwama yesterday gives immense satisfaction the innate bloodlust that present different amounts all humans makes you look more righteous and more patriotic compared the many you want paint anti national let kill four thousand pakistanis said goswami the ones talking peace should slapped and paraded donkey said the dangerously deranged kangana ranaut let war said every third person social media yet none them would stop and think for moment that again these underpaid soldiers who would have put their lives the line actually has happen all that even assume that just beasts the other side war mongering lets you put nice cloak over all that should thinking about this hour once you whip that frenzy some channels and pages are effectively doing the job easy questions will asked why the intelligence warnings were not heeded why proper armoured vehicles were not provided why the route they took was not checked and sanitised why the crpf jawans are grossly underpaid when have enough money spare for fighter jet deal several times the earlier cost why the conflict kashmir was stepped after the relative calm that existed 2014 what has taken over the minds the most educated minds kashmir for them take arms what has led them how did state which witnessed high polling percentages just five years back turn into one where elections are virtually impossible where only less than are turning when has happened some pockets who freed jaish mohammed commander maulana mazood azar who was lodged indian jail why have there been massive increase terror attacks under government which came power promising put end all and which claimed that has successfully crushed terrorism through demonetisation rahul gandhi press conference today which said that this should not politicised might look graceful but not talking about all really not the solution these political questions need asked not blame someone but ensure that such gruesome murders are put end yet all these questions are now buried the war mongering and the attacks imaginary tukde tukde gang unleashed the sangh media and social media ecosystem fake news being spread from photoshopped image rahul gandhi sitting along with one the attackers one how the cpi kerala mouthpiece deshabhimani did not print the news the attack did prominently the front page need ask who are these people who are busy spreading fake news this hour creating hate against particular sections and creating divisions when there shouldn none need ask what their agenda and who stands gain from this need ask why they are diverting from the questions that need asked and creating imaginary enemies the answer there the face the ones who spoke campaign rally today war mongering solves nothing only gives you impression solution • praveen srp ,1

"too much dependence people from iit and iim career trainer teach freelancer all across india the thing noticed most polytechnic students are way better than most engineering students india
even though iit and iim students are not that much different intellectual ability than most indian student they gain lot having access resources most not have plus corporate leaders tend give more weight the brand value than actual results most iit students are now working managerial level counter this the economy need opened allow more companies set this will give ripple effect getting more core jobs graduates indian education system has crossed the line where serious revamp the entire system needed for the last years the sector has given limited impetus the growth story relying foreign nationalities help set corporate india true there are people who have challenged the system and made the nation proud but considering the potential the great nation the numbers who swim against the tide remains abysmally low its high time that the entire sector changed course can create and nurture potentials where stand now unfortunately the present higher education sector india like roulette wheel hard escape from its clutches but you are one the lucky ones you hit the jackpot favors less talent but creates populace that again studies and henceforth become teachers again the system the system solely existing make reason for the system exist the first place pure science streams have eroded itself that level where the sole existence subjects like zoology and applied chemistry and physics now create teachers rather than aspiring scientists the situation worse engineering streams where almost the graduates are unemployable any industry fortunately streams like english communication and and literature they have wide variety jobs that they are qualified for but its the sad truth that rarely their field learning policy documents and vision initiatives should used hardcore road map that can used predict and shape the future sector its highly important that eduction sector has clear view its role developing nation because ultimately each and every measurement growth country irrevocably depended the educated resource the same nation policy guidelines syllabus the strength any university its alumni the success the alumni the professional world directly linked the value that the university can impart its undergraduate and graduate training programs the syllabus these programs must written the alumni the benefit that the university gets real time feedback current industry needs and what might require the future this gives chance for the university provide skill development which valued and appreciated the industry obsolete technology still being taught colleges across india likelihood its use apocalypse this thought process must uprooted once the basic skills have been thought industry standard technology must imparted and studied detail otherwise industry will have take pain retraining new employees which puts the company backward trajectory economic sense present syllabus being created and modified people who used work the industry this needs stopped the alumni the most powerful organization that the university can trust blindingly alumni must involved each and every process the working the university helps the long run keep gold standard thesis works numerous shady companies have cropped which does for fee final year projects and thesis works students flock these organizations they can receive the final product with money rather than true effort this has curbed original thesis work should appreciated and awarded relevant training technologies can mitigate lack confidence students and help inspire original thought processes students must benefit from technological prowess available and competent guides who can guide them rote learning should avoided and learning should imparted seminar style topics must thought drill the concepts initially and then promote self learning through self made experiments and research most universities multi disciplinary research and thesis works are not allowed noted that the boundaries study subjects are blurry line and most topics overlap each other students and graduate research fellows must given the flexibility research multidisciplinary topics rather than stay within well defined dark boundary engagement programs universities must have the potential leverage industrial experts take talks relevant topics least twice trice week that can conveniently held after class hours not disturb regular discussion instruction hours the benefit this method many students benefit from actual industry working knowledge and multiple topics can covered during the same bell curve grading grading must bell curve that shows students and learning associates where they stand relation the rest the class rather than blatant pass fail grade that provide information service provider questions must engaging ones that simulate the critical thinking faculties the ward dissuade students from rote learning methods like open book learning and sheets with formulas and data values must provided the advantage such system that students will forced learn the concepts and move beyond industry real life are workers forced recall mundane equations and data values even its emergency situation critical failure component factory equations not help there experience and wisdom helps that achieved and made logical thinking processes usage technological tools for better learning are lucky live age where all information can easily accessed anywhere the entire wealth human knowledge now available through the power the internet hard paper back textbooks must shunned away and replaced internet resources and line well off line discussion groups periodic test and assessment should done and evaluated using line tools that can exactly pinpoint parts sections that particular student must concentrate this also helps minute tracking the learning process and make sure individual attention can given for certain students certain topics language proficiency this the most important and relevant need students and faculty must highly proficient english language now the facto standard for communication across the world has needed given more preference than regular topics communication standards for students across india abysmal its best english language learning must given golden place among primary learning centers and undergraduate schools our researchers and graduates suffer lot due their lack proficiency which immediately closes lot doors significant effort need overhaul the higher education sector india the usage relevant tools and methodologies must taken haste hasten development the national skill set copying blindly the process nations that may may not relevant and suitable our conditions may more harm than good but imperative the change and development has happen time already past make the changes rapid overhauling with vision the only hope make india leader highly competitive world ",1

when was immigrating colleague who had worked previously told one thing the biggest difference between the west and india general people the west observe guidelines while indians break laws think some the reasons for this had very few opportunities and lot competition following rules meant getting left behind even have quotes glorifying this ghee seedhi ungli nikle ungli tedi karni padti hai like wtf too many movies glorifying ethically wrong things done meet end goal which just have hammered into indians that you not get any kind justice complying with the system the general lack opportunities has somehow registered people head outcome muslim appeasement reservation instead holding politicians responsible for not creating environment where there are enough opportunities around there has been rising sentiment against these two groups which actually are worse off than the rest what find scary here people who not seem have been affected this and are doing well life too seem harbor this resentment some folks seem take issue with few from these groups doing well their success always attributed facilities provided them while their own success always attributed hard work while privilege played big role the government doesn’ anything for fuck attitude hindus also feel they have been wronged socially cast setup questioned all the time they feel there are hindus being converted islam and christianity all the time hoards the numbers reflect otherwise but intuition tells them they are threat check out ted talk alan smith “why trust intuition over even the most reliable numbers ” these fears have been played big way right wing parties since the 90s and big way the last decade love jihad ghar wapsi and gau raksha are some very successful campaigns which have been launched based these fears hindus have the panchayat system… this just lets caste and religion based concepts fester everyone knows everyone there little room for people lose their identity you are always associated with your family its occupation and social standing even when someone escapes this system and moves urban setting she still associated with this setup families which have lived away from this setup for generation two still refer their original location native and refuse lose this identity ’ seen friends parents totally removed from their family’ historic occupation talk theirs for being superior while dissing someone else’ this superiority complex has carried manner where folks who were historically less well off are still not treated with respect they deserve this are better than them attitude has also morphed have remain better than them attitude too another factor introducing the any means possible attitude can keep going and with the reasons for this but bottom line indians are sentimental about all the wrong things which shouldn’ relevant anymore and this has skewed their sense what socially right underhanded approaches and violence pursued allaying their concerns are celebrated rather than condemned ",1

first the author conclusion that buddhism lacks selfless love wrong straight out the gate really couldn more wrong the whole ideal bodhisattva help all beings attain enlightenment there other way become buddha than that buddhas and bodhisattvas are definition motivated selfless love half the realization emptiness selfless love compassion there emptiness without compassion even the context the theravadan example they posted how the offerings the laity monks not selfless love they are freely giving themselves and their possessions someone else not selfless love because the recipients are monks that doesn make any sense will admit that some the faults they find with jodo shinshu are somewhat valid but not because think they are true but because think they are very common misconceptions arrive shin buddhism part the mahayana has all the selfless love and everything else associated with the mahayana whole but the emphasis even evil person being able reach the pure land can hard understand and can seem very christiany there also the idea shin buddhism that you immediately attain buddhahood upon birth the pure land can sound like you don have anything but say amida name one time honestly don think shinran ever actually meant that you would immediately become buddha upon rebirth and think certain passages his writings are misinterpreted towards that conclusion frankly this why never stuck with jodo shinshu don think modern shin teachings entirely line with what shinran was saying this partly because shinran writings are incredibly dense and difficult parse which another reason was dissatisfying the issue one repetition the comment entirely misunderstood you don say once and get saved you have receive faith first and this usually gained through daily recitation and deep listening investigating the teachings and your own reality when you really realize your bombu nature your inability help yourself that what opens your heart receive faith shin buddhism that moment your faith stabilized and frankly this faith should make you better person doesn just give you free pass let you disassociate something supposed allow you build and recognize fuller picture your own flawed reality you can really recognize and accept yourself warts and all that the moment you can begin change and change without overbearing sense guilt you might get from christianity and that what shin buddhism aiming you can recognize your faults how can you become better person but honestly think all these issues could have been avoided the author the comment had been familiar with other pure land schools like jodo shu mainland pure land rather than shin shin rather unique some its interpretations other school teaches that you will attain buddhahood upon rebirth and opinion the notion rather silly and contradicts pretty much the entirety buddhism other schools not place the emphasis one own inability that makes sound like you don need change have selfless love don think any these things interpreted the comment are truly part shin buddhism but they are common misinterpretations with the way commonly taught ,1

 somewhat agree that bjp any other party shouldn have instigated the issue air strike their political turmoil but the change perception that india has been able achieve both from viewpoint pakistan well other global nations something that needs credited modi publicizing both surgical strike and air strike india has put pakistan backfoot with difference opinion starkly visible especially time air strike mumbai attacks nothing more was done except threaten cross border strikes and movement troops along with border and wikipedia actually notes this entirely different way pakistan moved troops towards the border with india voicing concerns about the indian government possible plans launch attacks pakistani soil did not operate after days talks the pakistan government however decided start moving troops away from the border like pakistan itself was attacked and wronged instead india come feb 2019 even after air strike nation has apparently sided with pakistan even any islamic nation and neither has anyone else has dared tell india keep cool which usually used happen the past with airstrike pakistan backfoot both international well internal front surgical strike air strike both indian forces were capable past too then question remains why neither happened even times only modi has shown political willpower and risk taking ability give much sought ahead nod again the same should credited him and this years though indian forces kashmir has been bearing sharp attacks but major attacks has happened any other internal province state india far remember thank you ,1

 why did you quit the bjp wanted quit the day modi was made the prime ministerial candidate for the party why did you feel that way uncomfortable whatever has happened think know too much was just uncomfortable think that was not good choice bad choice but colleagues said that everybody deserves second chance especially public life and does modi they also said that there are too many checks and balances delhi there supreme court the media more intense the parliament are sure going change give him second choice that felt was sane advice gave him chance waited resigned february 2015 gave him months then when saw that more the same things were happening did the only honourable thing that could done — quit can you explain what you mean same things the same things that were happening gujarat — you know one man and the bureaucrats kind running the show the same thing happening the centre fact one man running the country and another man running the party just one man and his cabal running the country — the same kind surveillance and pressure the media society and dissidence — what they did gujarat same thing they are doing across the country one man taking all major policy decisions like was gujarat — demonetisation gst this and that months could figure out that things will not change precisely this lot were okay with voting for bjp and fact thought that they were the logical choice after upa shenanigans just not under modi and shah announcing him the candidate and the majority support for him just felt like betrayal most people who aren hindus you joined the party 2004 before that 2001 the gujarat riots happened and even before that advani was widely acknowledged the architect unrest that led the babri masjid demolition and the riots that followed you said you wanted something for the country how did you overlook the party communal history didn think there was any logic this violence 2001 was actually extremely proud the fact that vajpayee talked about rajdharma and expressed his disapproval for modi discriminatory politics letter obtained through rti found that rare instance atal behari vajpayee had written modi after the riots reminding him what his job was and that was not fan discrimination another thing that due the intra party politics could not fire modi wanted that flight goa everyone pounced upon him and couldn anything empathised with his handicaps number one was running party coalition his position was not one absolute power within the party think the control the party was still with advani felt wanted things change but couldn change attraction the bjp was not bjp was not rss was vajpayee heh good that they did not let but feel that this response fair guess just saw meaningful job the end the day how would you describe the trajectory the cell the cell trajectory went bit like simi the first president simi who was instrumental starting now professor united states and this banned organisation india started simi with different objective you know help muslim students who were backward using the power education help them progress the founder later said that was the idea behind simi later became banned organisation the cell started with very different mandate was not created abuse people actually think the people who joined 2004 that wasn even the culture the party the bjp used cultured party mean there was some sense some decorum within the party now has crossed all limits would you have advice how fix what the cell has become you cannot fix the cell until you fix the party president savage ,1

alright convince that modi not good for india have seen lots criticism for modi these past couple days and has been the rise but most that criticism for frivolous things like travelling too much taking selfies seriously give afew reasons why you think modi policies are bad because let real the development the rise just afew days ago heard that modi government making road per day whereas the previous gov was per road this was one his speeches his youtube channel honest opinion you people can find anything criticize modi the policy front you make nonsense award returning and other bull shit like that you wanna criticize modi then ahead but ready compare and contrast policies instead simply criticizing him for travelling too much this really how indian politics run criticizing the one who doing work for minor things instigate the public into voting him out even though the poor guy would probably achieve times much the previous government achieved years ,-1

you don need support party every single issue there was party which was not corrupt economically responsible and socially progressive would totally support reality have choose between corrupt and nepotistic congress and socially regressive bjp not like the other parties are much better than bjp this issue either congress was power for years but did not bother doing anything about section 377 either even now shashi tharoor brought this bill his personal capacity you will find many leaders who personally support gay rights even inside bjp not that matters ,1

 don really think any use viewing countries good bad countries are countries they arbitrary legal boundaries and the inhabitants and land within those boundaries don really believe there anything achieved quantifying how good they are have say that think there are some major issues within the culture though for one thing india was voted one poll the worst country which woman now don agree with the result that poll think there are worse countries for women course but anywhere near the bottom indicates pretty enormous systemic issues that desperately need fixed addition think pretty dismissive just blame the rape numbers population there are plenty countries with large population densities which don have such issue with rape plus the numbers reported rape are one thing but that doesn include the numbers people who don report rape for instance sweden had very large surge rapes not long ago but was only because that was the same year that they redefined the legal definition rape general don entirely understand why but india has opinion very unhealthy relationship with sex not saying all indians but pretty much all women know have had regularly very uncomfortable interactions with indian men trying hit them proposition them for sex send them uncomfortable messages has basically come the stage that almost stereotype lot western countries would assume that has something with having relatively conservative attitude towards sex and dating idk all know that there uncanny amount women who had similar experiences the phone scammers thing understand but you have get why people the western world would have their opinions influenced that get about scam calls from india per month and extremely fucking annoying plus the people who really fall for these scams are the elderly and the vulnerable course people aren super fond india this regard one thing very much agree with though the cultural damage which was done the country through colonisation which the rest the world seems conveniently forget lot the time basically don hate india indians think that india bad country but think has some very serious issues which need addressed and lot the issues people have with the country aren entirely unfounded ,-1
