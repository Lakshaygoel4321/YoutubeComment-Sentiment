 going disagree here not with the part dealing your parents behavior with you but definitely the part where see imran khan and peace the same sentence before labelling bhakt modi fan war mongering hyper nationalist just listen out after that you feel there factual inconsistency there some loophole argument free engage with you and hear you you must first understand that imran khan isn the saint what the world trying make him just because sounds convincing and uses words like peace and logic doesn anyway reflect his stance and policies terrorists pakistan facade long used pakistan and has been there modus operandi project image peaceloving nation and often claiming the victim terrorism imran khan himself has used the army come the power and the pakistani army hands glove with isi helps terrorists they anti terrorists they should thanking for destroying the terrorists even certain sections want praise the indians for this they won because then they have answer the questions following like how long had these terrorists camps had been operating and what are the steps the pakistani govt taking counter such camps far the release indian pilot concerned they had release him because the don have much choice per the protocol and given the present situation and they want projected thr the nice guys when sushma swaraj says was preemptive strike not against any nation but terrorist outfits and return indian defence installations are attacked about which now have evidence the f16 shot down presented during the army press briefing should enough botheration what were pakistani jets trying accomplish not undermine the sovereignty the indian state the indian side says aren targeting the pakistani army and return pakistani air force tries bomb indian defence establishment then who escalating the war this logic they should also attack usa because the americans fucked laden pakistani soil and despite known for harbouring terrorists over decades they still have the fuckin audacity talk about peace peace isn not retaliating and protecting people peace taking care that insidious activities take place your sovereign territory and looking that those who disturb peace are brought justice really embrace imran khan can arrest the likes hafiz saeed masood azhar and long list terrorists both recognized the and the the indian agencies but until that day will only hypocrite and nothing else tommorow know that stern action taken against such people might even nominate him for the peace prize but should prove that has the balls and even after all these facts you trying say the indian side that wants war then that equivalent victim shaming the rest leave your fine sense judgement but please learn read between the lines the world would have been lot better place people were actually what they portray cms asia 44965868,1

pulwama attack cannot justified any reasoning whatsoever the people who killed our soldiers should brought justice sad part that the whole incident highlighted how much the bjp trying gain from anti pakisthan sentiment congress also opportunist congress another idiot that cannot anything because they have power left they lost credibility they looted the country for years used think pak media much propaganda driven and encashing general hatred towards india but now see difference between our and their media our soft corner for our brave soldiers has been missused for ages but the picture clear political parties have been using generalised hatred against each other tool and nothing else this has been going for ages and will continue sad see any rational question against bjp claim regarding the strike becomes antinational being leftist etc etc saw news channels asking users not spread abhinandan video because another trick pakistan think because people would praise pak army for being nice ,1

absolutely true there are few more things that should included when looking his appeal firstly his strongman image india and also worldwide there trend towards people who make brash provocative statements being seen strong leaders trump for instance considered his supporters stronger leader than obama though the latter actually carried out more deportations and got osama killed modi takes step further and combines with bold not necessarily good initiatives like demo and the recent air strikes against pakistan now well known that demo was complete failure and what the air strikes actually achieved terms strategic objectives unclear best but from political perspective country like india these are brilliant moves after demo people were saying idea was good only implementation was bad though implementation optional component the govt responsibilities and not the most important component course the idea itself was insane but let not there this has led the least doing something syndrome despite the fact that previous govts also have done something yet that perception has been created and modi excellent spotting this key differentiator that why the govt keeps harping about nehru and other past and dead pms that why every bjp shill keeps parroting the white lie that nothing happened years combine that with the notion that everything the has done historic even when essentially rebranded existing initiatives but his greatest trump card was and will always rahul gandhi not only because that man walking gaffe machine fair modi but modi has carefully created media network that will suppress this fact the real problem with raga and his sister they are boy scout politicians raga seems have forgotten that the three state elections were not the thumping inc victories that were expected the inc won them very narrowly all modi needed turn the tide was major national crisis modi being political genius quickly seized upon pulwama even person who intensely dislikes modi and extremely skeptical his handling pulwama cannot imagine raga handling any better than modi finally has said that the alternatives are not very promising raga shitshow mamata the next most likely candidate just fascist and authoritarian modi not more most the opposition alliances only exist beat modi that the only glue holding these rivals together should they succeed that glue will dissolve and most people know this ,1
yes your key point very sensible however you too are prejudiced and biased looking your own commentary counter questions about similar practices other religions you make valid point that false equivalency countering similar practices other religion way deflect the question recent examples include the charles hebdo incident where every single person india and very rightly condemned the attack however when rss and bjp members harass author into pulping his books there appears condemnation for the hindu right aren you doing the same thing which you accuse others doing you are using false equivalency and countering rss bjp narrative with charlie hebdo example you want the discussion limited critique hinduism without the use deflections giving examples other regions the same logic limit charlie hebdo massacre discussion what attack radicalized muslims not compare with bjp rss activities they are not the same category all ,1

washington post after pulwama the indian media proves the bjp’ propaganda machine noredirect utm source reddit com utm term bb3fa6258d98 our investigation into the indian media’ reporting the pulwama attack found that many reports were contradictory biased incendiary and uncorroborated news organizations such india today ndtv news the indian express first post mumbai mirror ani and others routinely attributed their information anonymous “government sources ” “forensic experts ” “police officers” and “intelligence officers ” independent investigations were conducted and serious questions about intelligence failures were left unanswered once eliminated the spectacle realized that the indian public got very little information about the pulwama attack and its aftermath beyond the confusion over the death tolls balakot news organizations variously reported that between and 350 kilograms the explosive rdx was used the attack when such information was officially released reports also identified different people the supposed masterminds the pulwama attack various points without clear sourcing more than two weeks after the attack our analysis finds that news site had rectified the errors their reporting leaving these misleading facts matter public record ,1

people don seem understand this this anger and violence that you are seeing now has been there since before this government came power the majority decided vote block because they weren happy with the policies the previous government congress scams was one reason but the deal breaker was minority appeasement before 2014 ensuring the minorities voted block while dividing the majority vote was the way elections were won every party had their own minority block the hindus somehow got frustrated with this and decided vote block just like the minority and they decided vote for the bjp that why the bjp won 2014 landslide wasn promises development that got the bjp votes was the fact that the bjp was the only party that seemed appease the majority their history was such that the majority hindus felt comfortable with the bjp power rather than the congress when the bjp won they got emboldened because they saw the the kind power the majority hindus wield indian politics now they think that their turn pandered they aren scared because this government does not pander the minorities anymore this why violence the majority visible now ,1

 not bjp supporter they haven earned trust and they probably won and don have context for all the points raised only try answer the ones able \ deal 2007 2014 that literally more than one term government tactics change after each term meet the pressing political scenario \ antics played incompetent opposition maintain the resemblance that they actually opposition \ 2011 the was ruling and the bjp felt that afspa couldn removed under that government the second part understanding that they would have used the legislature start the process get rid article 370 they had had majority the government \ politics nothing new see here modi met bose one relatives this year and said would consider which obviously stalling tactic \ opposition being obstructive opposition \ there real intent probably trying please the industries who would have shell out cash for improvements their drainage systems also not allowing ash dumping the river would virtually make people arms against the government years gives them lot leeway \ they were against but nandan nilekani met the and pitched him managing convince him let the program stay that what read the news month two after the elections took place \ politicians being politicians \ revenge for voting aap power hurts see the tamasha that happening the moment grant full state hood delhi and stalling the aap becomes impossible aap also incompetent and complains too much but that different topic \ you quote august 2013 article before and april 2013 after seriously don even see fucking turn because the bjp helped the congress pass the bill bjp turn black money before lakh after jumla \ citations your part but narendra modi had said that there much abroad that bringing back would enough give lakhs everyone that doesn mean promised give everyone lakhs \ they were really two faced about this all the while when they opposed they actually helped the congress push the bill through the lok sabha \ obvious case want score political points \ don see how allowing fdi equivalent allowing privatization privatization only happens they allow the private sector control the system \ just politics they didn lower the limit can called turn \ their excuse adequate planning the budget would take another month and cost lot money \ continuation policies quite normal see that happen \ opposition being opposition name one country where the opposition doesn turn once power \ government doesn endorse his view \ don fucking see net neutrality either article don fucking slap words just because you want 66a during the legal process the government was the defendant couldn withdraw the litigation anything the sort the case was continuing from upa2 and belief that the government counsel told the government that the only thing they could that stage was defend and not suddenly change their opinion ,-1

there couple reasons see for this though have been struggling formulate them into something coherent generally speaking long periods time dominated one side often results resurgence the other and that has been part but genuinely believe that specifically the right there growing population secular guess libertarians for lack better word the traditional right which was the dominant sector republicans shrinking the day and the next generation republicans aren going anything like the last gone are the days when gay marriage and religion were one the primary issues the right while issues like guns and migration will still primary issues the party expect see republicans whole become drastically more secular and oriented around nationalism and limited government rather than religion europe thats already happened quite while ago fact many places europe their parties are more far left and moderate left rather then the more traditional left wing right wing parties true right wing doesn exactly exist anymore europe atleast not large scale though europe there has been resurgence and based biased opinion people were tired political correctness persay they were tired the regulations the migration and often limited speech afd got relatively low numbers germany but they are growing quickly and very well could become primary party marie pen very nearly won and trump did the left the and the overall popularity right wing politics once again growing marie pen afd and donald trump are right wing but its not the fact that their right wing that causing resurgence think better call these parties nationalist people want their country put first again they want their sovereignty held above anything else not migrants not the their country donald trump campaign ran nationalism and putting the usa first things like migration nationalism and potentially free speech are going key issues for right wing parties and this the primary reason that right wing parties are beginning come back people were largely turned off the religious zeal the 90s gop while now still predominantly conservative this conservatism very much orientated around economics and migration rather than religion which has the potential draw people who were otherwise the fence and lot more appealing the average person ,1

 this seems like extremely biased article from the huffington post read through and don think the government has done anything wrong here firstly the ease doing business rankings are heavily covered the indian media use them barometer judge how well the government doing not the government fault these rankings are taken seriously the voting population and business houses the country secondly the rankings themselves have serious flaws they only consider data from few dozen respondents rather than actual data from the government they also cover only two cities delhi and mumbai rather than the entrie country the government lobbied heavily and correctly imo change the methodology but was unable thirdly the article states that the government implemented reforms like eliminating the need for company seal rubber stamp open bank account and eliminating the need submit cancelled cheque part the employee provident fund application process department revenue eliminated the need for traders submit hard documents and tried improve the capacity the online customs payment gateway the latest report shows the government managed eliminate one step reducing procedures and also seemingly reduced the time required days for delhi and days for mumbai why this wrong the government enacted simple measures improve the ease doing business india they were low hanging fruit easy implement measures which should have been enacted decades ago there nothing wrong with the government focusing ranking its voters consider important and there nothing wrong the reforms implemented the issue lies the way the world bank measures this ranking this has already been highlighted the government and they lobbied change this ranking procedure which has failed not sure where the government has gone wrong and honestly seems like nit picking huffington post print negative news ,-1

 top vijay mallya just resigned from united spirits and got payout million rs515cr not pedantic but couldn resist because intermittent ocd sorry how can they ask the banks waive off loans worth lakhs crores without having estimate how the big defaulters are the banks know who are the borrowers and rbi does not this not issue secondly the loans are not being waived cancelled forgiven forgotten that wrong and dangerous word use this context the loans are being written off what that means you say earlier you post that once the borrower has failed service the loan willingly due the things can control the banks write off called provisioning could partial full that their and balance sheet show the true reflection their own health rajan pushing for aggressive approach you mention later the post that does not mean that the borrower walks away the banks continue make efforts recover the money through notices public shaming selling assets borrower change management restructuring conversion into equity court cases sale loan arcs etc loan part that has been written off the bank and the bank manages recover the amount written back and becomes profit for that year interesting example here would the business cycle mid 90s early 2000s that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually worse shape than today but fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most the bank clients turned around and banks averted disaster most borrowers were commodity companies that time steel cement etc this time this not likely happen the mess wouldn clear itself they could have taken measure make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money not only did they not take these measures they actually forced the banks lend their favored borrowers one the biggest defaulter unitech which people say gandhi family company rumor don ask for source group another big defaulter was close bsp jindals congress hcc pawar dlf huda vadra and they will benefit immensely from this loan write off and bailouts the government banks play the book which big ask they need not seize their fucking assets they have given personal guarantee seize their homes too what happens next short term government puts equity into the banks and they somehow survive medium term hopefully this government puts professional management into the top layers the bank board and cmd and the rot contained happening bank baroda but again tall ask long term the relative size the psu bank will shrink pvt banks will become bigger one last point why are politicians reluctant reforming privatizing the banks because that the biggest tool granting favors corporates who turn are the biggest political donors the last last point there silver lining the bank problem stock problem the loans already given are going bad and need deal with what the system does not have fortunately the flow problem new money coming into the system and the investment cycle picks will have the money fund ,1

when modi asked for people participation keep the nation clean meant exactly this perhaps should have spelt out these dumbass kids whose parents never taught them clean their litter after them few years ago had opportunity talk reporter from the hindu who told story sometimes the president india likes address the reporters press room casual manner the rashtrapathi bhavan and always there are refreshments and such provided the journalists when abdul kalam was the president had one such event went for about minutes and they were about wind kalam had noticed that there were couple coffee cups plates strewn around lying the floor near the journalists chairs promptly asked all the journos clean behind them and added you see was teacher first and will always one think this class exercise and realize that there nothing demeaning about cleaning after oneself should also add that sometimes people not know exactly how they can contribute when you ask for people participation keep our country clean some may not know how contribute and many may not even realize the effects their actions how plastic bags are strewn around this picture give them solid task and you can expect them think duty modi could have just asked our indian citizens present there today clean after themselves what little extent they can and then perhaps these kids might have got teach kids values give people specifics about how contribute also anecdote involving abdul kalam when was the president ,1

the article author does bring out some points which are pertinent although not for the same reason the author must have intended democracy what matters most win votes how one party candidate achieves that irrelevant ideally people must vote for candidate after researching his her views opinions background history etc ideally candidate must around informing people what she will elected what his her opinions are various issues ideally media should act behalf the people actively posing the candidate pertinent questions that people themselves would have liked ask him her media should analyse the candidate views opinions and actions educate and empower the people act wisely however are far from the ideal the one hand have people being swayed propaganda demagoguery and populism the other have media actively facilitating empowering and educating the politician out power instead the people such world politician can away with any non stipulatory practices where the dangers his her real face being revealed real instead she employs spin doctors press conferences town hall meets one one interviews one one interaction with people are ideal practices but people vote irrespective whether one practices them not politician wouldn want risk practicing like passing exam not mandatory the next class why take all rahul gandhi has started practice doing all this for this election because has very less baggage has relatively clean image wins this election and form govt seen whether will have the same alacrity when running for his second term ,1

 didn vote for bjp either but was all ready vote for them 2019 because realized any government will need ten years show changes unlike feel statements like this country fucked over reaction yes have had quite few headline grabbing events the past one month but none them barring the haryana incident perhaps affected anything more than the population there whole wide world outside what the media covers and things are improving there but agree where coming from and truly pissed the way the government has been derailing its own mandate reforms our country are such low hanging fruit that the government could have done nothing but the bare minimum technology deployments and they would have been back power 2019 now not really sure have never ever felt such viciousness from any party its supporters was not alive during indira gandhi tenure would any day take scam over almost the entire population feeling victimized brain washed one way the other ready for third front 2019 true reforms will much slower but india has grown earlier when the government was auto pilot can continue run that way instead risking civil war something ,1

 here copy the judgment 1427183283 pdf you can add this the post 123 page judgement reading now and will post there anything worth sharing first the final judgement 119\ conclusion may summarise what has been held above section 66a the information technology act 2000 struck down its entirety being violative article and not saved under article section 69a and the information technology procedure safeguards for blocking for access information public rules 2009 are constitutionally valid section valid subject section being read down mean that intermediary upon receiving actual knowledge from court order being notified the appropriate government its agency that unlawful acts relatable article are going committed then fails expeditiously remove disable access such material similarly the information technology intermediary guidelines” rules 2011 are valid subject rule sub rule being read down the same manner indicated the judgment section 118 the kerala police act struck down being violative article and not saved article summary reasons cited section 66a freedom speech and expression under our constitutional scheme stated earlier not open the state curtail freedom speech promote the general public interest reasonable restrictions quoting from another judgement the right freedom speech and expression includes the right disseminate information wide section the population possible the access which enables the right exercised also integral part the said right the wider range circulation information its greater impact cannot restrict the content the right nor can justify its denial public order all these counts clear that the section has proximate relationship public order whatsoever the example guest hotel annoying girls telling – this court has held that mere annoyance need not cause disturbance public order clear and present danger – tendency affect viewed either the standpoint the clear and present danger test the tendency create public disorder section 66a would not pass muster has element any tendency create public disorder which ought essential ingredient the offence which creates defamation section 66a does not concern itself with injury reputation something may grossly offensive and may annoy inconvenient somebody without all affecting his reputation clear therefore that the section not aimed defamatory statements all incitement offence section 66a has nothing with “incitement offence” section 66a severely curtails information that may sent the internet based whether grossly offensive annoying inconvenient etc and being unrelated any the eight subject matters under article must therefore fall foul article and not being saved under article declared unconstitutional decency morality what has been said with regard public order and incitement offence equally applies here section 66a cannot possibly said create offence which falls within the expression ‘decency’ ‘morality’ that what may grossly offensive annoying under the section need not obscene all – fact the word ‘obscene’ conspicuous its absence section 66a vagueness quite obviously prospective offender section 66a and the authorities who are enforce section 66a have absolutely manageable standard which book person for offence under section 66a chilling effect and overbreadth therefore hold that the section unconstitutional also the ground that takes within its sweep protected speech and speech that innocent nature and liable therefore used such way have chilling effect free speech and would therefore have struck down the ground overbreadth possibility act being abused not ground test its validity section 66a otherwise invalid cannot saved assurance from the learned additional solicitor general that will administered reasonable manner governments may come and governments may but section 66a goes forever assurance from the present government even carried out faithfully would not bind any successor government must therefore held that section 66a must judged its own merits without any reference how well may administered severability the present case where has been held above section 66a does not fall within any the subject matters contained article and the possibility its being applied for purposes outside those subject matters clear therefore hold that part section 66a severable and the provision whole must declared unconstitutional article challenge found invalid the petitioners were right this article argument would apply equally all other offences created the information technology act which are not the subject matter challenge these petitions find therefore that the challenge the ground article must fail procedural unreasonablenes having struck down section 66a substantive grounds need not decide the procedural unreasonableness aspect the section section 69a will noticed that section 69a unlike section 66a narrowly drawn provision with several safeguards first and foremost blocking can only resorted where the central government satisfied that necessary secondly such necessity relatable only some the subjects set out article thirdly reasons have recorded writing such blocking order that they may assailed writ petition under article 226 the constitution section being exemption provision closely related provisions which provide for offences including section 69a have seen how under section 69a blocking can take place only reasoned order after complying with several procedural safeguards including hearing the originator and intermediary have also seen how there are only two ways which blocking order can passed – one the designated officer after complying with the 2009 rules and the other the designated officer when has follow order passed competent court the knowledge spoken the said sub rule must only through the medium court order subject this the information technology intermediaries guidelines rules 2011 are valid ,-1

you are simpleton and have been victim superficial propaganda you think bjp and its supporters including have such retarded things beef mandir etc our agenda its all media hype with only the whackos taking these petty issues seriously its the low hanging fruit for the lowest common denominator sane person the bjp camp even talks about these things hard bjp supporter including their religious agenda and let tell you brief how think greentext tiem india highly fragmented feudal and poor only ideologies make this diverse bunch behave like country slavery the name gandhi hindutva search your feelings and history and you know true ridiculous that foreign woman from different race religion country continent born and raised under different set cultural values for decades can come here under the banner gandhi and almost accepted our prime minister and was definitely accepted the head the most powerful political party india for over decade country diverse india predicted west balkanize somehow went through its bankruptcy and came out single nation state reason hindutva hinduism slavery name gandhi strong the abomination from the foreign whore literally cannot talk straight for than minutes literally makes sense all congress wants him the next prime minister their friends media intellectual circles and corporations end supporting him because they despise hindutva for real imagined reasons clearly congress has done and will more damage the country than hindutva can even imagine have good leaders hindutva modi and shah modi has actually proven himself gujarat done good work spread out over decade these can separate the rhetoric from reality advani was too much mandir movement modi uses hindutva gather support but does per wants good pragmatic politician now the rest how muslims must behave something according anyone who supports congress the enemy our nation state doesn matter how you give your allahus your akbars how you shove your jesus your christ how believing chubby kid with talking elephant head gives you meaning life you support congress then you are traitor book and you must eliminated any means necessary you support any other party then willing tolerate right now destruction neutralization the congress support infrastructure across political social and economic circles should our top priority now assuming the congress support infrastructure destroyed then and only then and not before rss becomes problem must eliminate them replaced better trained and equipped police force under independent judiciary but with covert powers hindu intellectuals become problem must eliminate them anyone who tries add religious talk education gets ass fucked hindu muslim christian cow piss magic bullshit earth 6000 years old and being pedo under special situations totally bro talk can and about this but won for the purposes this thread these points are enough and about ram mandir the rightfully hindu territory and will have back time the hate muslims have for american christian troops for polluting their sacred land mecca official motivation bin laden apparently the same hate hindus have against muslims for polluting our sacred land ayodhya only its worse our case because christians churches are not actually present inside mecca but muslims mosques are actually present the site ayodhya its also worse because christians came saudi arabia with the consent the government king whatever but muslims are staying ayodhya when have clearly stated that don want them there don give fuck where muslims choose live and build mosques india but atleast leave our sacred temples alone you motherfuckers don understand how this even for debate babri mosque culturally pretty insignificant muslims some mosque made name king but ayodhya and ram mandir are culturally extremely important for hindus the city 7th avatar vishnu who the preserver part the supreme being holy shit just give that small piece land and let worship our heroes and their flying monkey sidekicks why won muslims give possible that muslims think even the destruction single mosque for good infidel cause anywhere the world means that the holy war islam against infidels just took step back and that cannot allowed happen just imagine how much peace would there muslims let build our temple like holy shit can achieve many different goals simultaneously creates good impression hindu community discourages communal politics throughout india makes leaders like advani irrelevant rss and bjp loses good part its support you can emotionally blackmail hindus the future for reservations something this genius political and cultural move and yet muslims won this makes seriously question the loyalties muslims community seriously think they will demand another pakistan their numbers are high enough well just hope muslims begin rape and pillage europe soon that might see how the west reacts godhra style riot happens the west then they lose the moral right tell brownskins how deal with muslims and that gives our hindu right government that much free hand whatever the fuck wants ,1

 don think that surprising that right leaning politicians win elections around half the time the yes obama was president from 2009 2017 but before that george bush was president for years and before clinton republicans won out presidential elections between 1968 and 1988 these things tend back and forth like pendulum one side wins then takes things too far people put the other side charge for while the same most democratic countries different question but maybe the one you are really trying ask why immigration and nationalism have become hot button issues the last few years the 1990s and 2000s the right was more free market pro trade pro immigration because pro business but the last decade has because more nationalistic populist anti trade and anti immigration there are several explanations but every country going have different one for example europe has largely been driven the refugee crisis and the poor way that has been handled the various governments the began with the financial crisis and increase immigration under bush but has also been driven liberal overreach number social issues under obama top this you got social media replacing television the main way people get news that local incidents are often blown into national incidents would also note that both left and right the extremes are getting more attention you have sanders the facto leader democrats the corbyn the leader labour the melenchon doing quite well france etc ,1

ultimately feel comes down the voice acting scene and how differs between america and japan voice actors japan are idolized and fangasmed over our hollywood actors are and animation and video games are taken quite bit more seriously the eastern market compared the western for the video games part you really only have look south korea and the start the modern sports scene unless voice actor also well known live action star most western individuals would not able name that many voice actors until fairly recently animation the west has been looked down upon lesser art form possibly not even art form all depending who you ask and once again has only been comparatively recently that started seen more valid medium which express visual medium such our voice actor pool quite small now compare the eastern market animation well loved with long storied history that was taken seriously its market more less since the 60s not earlier with the advent televised animation series the voice actor pool for the eastern market huge and often entire career can made single animated series entire career nothing but animation voice work just have less those types actors around and they often have take whatever work comes their way continue their career leading gaps like this more than likely the previous actors were simply unavailable they were looking break out into more serious work the time could the mindset that animation and video game work still isn taken seriously the west though believe that slowly changing with pixar dreamworks could you say that square thinks don care about story ultimately think the problem lies with and our dismissal animation until fairly recently and the mindset western audiences regards cartoons there even problem all that has lead this gap ,1

hello have few questions related development specific sections android have least years work experience with android but general feels like months instead every single year vectordrawablecompat much like android there are way too many caveats and hacks that have keep looking before manage properly build app vectordrawablecompat feels useless use when you have mess with half the project settings make work for pre lollipop you don want use vector compatibility pre lollipop you have replace all app srccompat with android src avoid getting the error which says that you have enable vector compatibility library for that that would been great you could use anything seen this article about but doesn show any example memory usage and configuration updating issue only the mechanism far noticed some people stackoverflow suggest use appcompatresources getdrawable context drawableres which most likely bypassing the delegate option and causing the same issue mentioned above people will more likely use this works one mentioning what actually doing like anyhow different than contextcompat getdrawable resid and then people will use even though might cause hell pre lollipop there still any other way fix this issue least any example see how does really break older versions and can disable app srccompat don want use fragments animator after whole year working with android still have idea what the correct way use fragments recently stumbled upon problem where supposed flip fragment another fragment with flip animation was hoping that official android documentation would help hide view but there major problem documentation using animator objects support fragments not work with animator objects how supposed use flip animation with support fragments this case can even find example rotation that doesn use animator objects some people say that nineoldandroids library should used for this can you update documentation page use updated animation frametwork instead using animator camera had work with camera1 api once never again even use some library here another surprise the library doesn have that thing that you need and then you have hassle around find way add break and back actual camera api again another case for such library that crashes older versions even minsdk fits the biggest problem here mostly creating actual camera view had adjust aspect ratio orientation cropping preview resolution and what not make somehow work along with complying lifecycle surface textureview activity fragment and camera itself after hoping works check out samsung device broken redo everything again until find out preview size not working well are there any plans for compatibility library for camera make easier use with actual lifecycle along with cameraview avoid constant struggle seeing what the actual proper way load preview this camera outdated and mostly never used content android studio still shows many old resources from gingerbread for compatibility purposes along with that compatibility and google play library contains loads resources that fills the whole list where can pick own resources without digging are there any plans simplifying least filtering resource selection avoid this logcat logcat great use until you get literally unrelated and unremoveable logs like egl emulation that doesn help lot that keep filling the logs instead the ones you wrote want filter those then have create another filter and write package name separately each time for each app cannot pick show only selected application anyhow possible put easier way exclude tags and specify automatically package name from selected application emulator quick boot emulator has been improved for while which good thing personally don want use quick boot option usually disable however the option disable quick boot literally gone some system images like oreo x86 system image but not gone oreo x86 system image this intended and possible add option choose between cold and quick boot this case geocoder this thing broken literally far noticed will fail about out 100 attempts more less even with same identical request does use google maps platform api feels like behavior from google maps api has similar failure rates api key not used are you going remove this though support native have native and support fragments you have decided deprecate fragments android support fragments work all platforms the same way more less while native ones are not nested fragments for example there feature implement something without adding sdk and instead added support library why such feature added sdk anyway and then later due incompatibilites added support library isn easier maintain such feature support library separately simplifying sdk there are loads components that require loads boilerplate make them work properly and solution for that not always obvious one example might asynctask which requires weak reference listener avoid memory leak and requires kept fragment will get destroyed activity unless stored which troubling for just starting single task that may either leak memory reference not cleared properly never reach activity configuration changed destroyed rotation that things just wrong you want stop the task don know how much androidx and ktx will help with this but hope that this will eliminate components that shouldn used anymore and that they can properly replaced with new components without loads trouble and boilerplate them setup are you going deprecate some components that shouldn any longer used and make simplified alternatives performance stability coding whenever work any app want make sure runs properly even lower end phones however when have use workarounds the nerves sometimes cannot handle this still trying create proper architecture make sure that things work and don break but always feels like something missing that something will break the architecture soon later had troubles with fragments but managed work easier with viewmodel and livedata though with sacrifice not using onsaveinstancestate which fragments still hell work with then again you have fragmentmanager that breaks lot you need manage backstack did managed use other library for but still feels like workaround still had some additional workarounds library doesn have some feature that can done with fragmentmanager when comes bad performance google own apps are literally huge size over 100 and methods about 100k 200k methods they stutter many times almost like they perform expensive operations main thread even though they should loaded separate thread and uses loads libraries some things also you look google app open source libraries list you most likely notice load libraries that are used about them what your opinion balancing performance stability and coding practice apps how far should work with boilerplate simplify code how far should optimize avoid any kind stuttering complaints old comment thread basically mess apis pic shows small part png deprecated methods get replaced with methods different name requiring higher api ending with making another wrapper use them setting foreground requires api but documentation says api listeners for software keyboard opening closing actually you can even open close keyboard without some small hack fragments are until you have use them stacks animate them smoothly and saving instance state usually there way get filename path from uri complex hopefully architecture components will help with saving state properly and make async operations easier along with room sqlite persistence don trust 3rd party libraries much when every library has different ways something ending with mess some required feature not implemented and starting all over with hack also don like most articles going hyped with some new library features and suddenly show magical tutorials showing simplest way but not realistic another problem for are outdated tutorials half them give solutions that are longer valid contain code with flaws causing memory leaks unstable functionality final note also apologize couldn express what wanted ask explain tired with working legacy projects that use deprecated api and loads workarounds make work ,1

 hate the aap because has absolutely real plans about improving the country situation corruption can only agenda for long there are problems this country more important and more destructive than corruption and the aap instead focusing them actually tries fuel those fires what will they when there some actual work done their delhi manifesto only shows promises they can hope meet irrelevant feel good policies that absolutely nothing for the country and the jan lokpal bill defeating corruption doesn automatically fix all the problems our country just like adding doesn result also disagree with the method they use defeat corruption they completely sideline development which instrumental and perhaps the only way about reducing corruption and instead focus doling out freebies limiting their exposure lower rung corruption and blaming other parties their daft policies are second reason not support them free electricity lower classes and reduction its price fixing vegetable prices have you learned nothing from the congress mistakes basic economics laal batti what the point that again your mlas will the only ones reach parliament half hour after assembly commences half salary for ministers this isn corruption bait the aap hasn single policy that makes iota sense the self righteousness displayed kejriwal and his goons worse than the emotional outbursts modi supporters the internet just watch any debate and cringe kumar vishwas yogender yadav throw unsubstantiated statements well accusations the bjp don care about the congress not going there they act though fighting against corruption the only reason for man descent from trees and thus are quick name the bjp and congress being the same without shred reason related either the stark differences their style governance the prosperity the states they govern and the level contentment within the people those states the fact that arvind kejriwal himself hasn proven his administrative skills and isn likely considering the fact that they hesitant about creating government delhi you know that thing they stood the elections dismissed them easily they dismiss the notion having agendas besides corruption ,1

\ kraustausi vilnių nors esu kaunietė būčiau dėkinga bet kokius būsto rajonų patarimus viskas visada priklauso nuo norisi gyventi arti centro jeigu nėra didelio skirtumo siūlyčiau keltis kokią jeruzalę fabijoniškes pašilaičius ten daug naujos statybos namų krūvos parduotuvių visko gali prireikti netoli namų pliusas gyvenant toliau nuo centro pigensė nuoma tiesa nėra labai daug pigesnė šiek tiek paieškojus galima rasti panašia kaina žirmūnuose antakalnyje šnipiškėse net naujamiestyje apie kiekvieną rajona truputį naujamiestis maždaug puse namų yra seni \ 1970 statybos juose šildymas yra tragiškai brangus tad jeigu toks namas nerenovuotas komunaliniai gali būti itin brangūs dalis namų yra dar senesni tačiau tarpukariu statytų namų šildymo kainos nėra tokios didelės dar derėtų paminėti buvusius fabrikus paverstus loftus kaikurie fabrikų negauna gyvenamojo pastato statuso dėl registruoti gyvenamosios vietos tuose namuose neįmanoma pats ieškodamas buto mačiau daug skelbimų nuomai būtent perdarytų fabrikų tad prieš nuomojantis patariu įsitikinti kad galima tame bute įsiregistruoti kad namas bus aptarnaujamas namų bendrijos naujamiesčio būsto žirmūnai galo daug pensininkų bet pakanakamai patogi vieta mieste geras susisiekimas lygniant naujamiesčiu šiek tiek švaresnis daug žalesnis rajonas kiek žinau didžioji dauguma yra blokiniai tad dėl šildymo yra šiokia tokia loterija žirmūnuose yra nemažai renovuotų namų antakalnis labai didelė dalis namų yra tokie patys seni kaip naujamiestyje rajonas yra prie nuostabaus miško upės jis jaučiasi itin ramus tačiau skirtingai nei per nerį esančiuose žirmūnuose čia gyvena nemažai jaunų žmonių apsigyventi antakalnyje patarčiau tik kur nors netoli šilo tilto kadangi juo važiuoja didelė dalis viešojo transporto link centro kitų rajonų šnipiškės visi gyvenantys tenai sako kad tai vis dar pavojingas rajonas panašiai kaip naujininkai vilniaus vilijampolė šnipiškės savaime mažai kuo išsiskirtų kitų vilniaus rajonų namai blokiniai naujos statybos tačiau yra kelios vietos kur tiesiog nekyla nors net ieškoti buto tai aplink kalvarijų turgų šanchajų ozo devynaukščiuose prie vilniaus licėjaus šnipiškėse turbūt yra mažiausiai žaliųjų erdvių visų rajonų tačiau tai gero geriausias rajonas susisiekimo požiūriu ten viešasis važiuoja parktiškai visur jeruzalė raudonasis vilniaus rajonas didžioji dauguma namų raudonų plytų kaikuriuose namų yra gana brangus šildymas tačiau rajonas yra galo tvarkingas ramus jeruzalėje jau nebevažiuoja troleibusai tačiau negalėčiau sakyti kad ten prastas susisiekimas jeruzalė yra visai šalia gražių takų palei nerį verkių regioninio parko fabijoniškės gero tolimiausias dar senos statybos rajonas jeigu nerūpi miesto centras norsi gyventi pakankamai pigiai fabijoniškės yra logiškas pasirinkimas namai kaip daug kur vilniuje seni blokiniai fabijoniškėse dar monolitinių aukščių yra šildymo kainos vidutiniškos labai nedaug žalių erdvių tačiau yra viskas gali reikėti yra salomėjos nėries pašilaičiai greičiausiai ten jau daugiau naujos statybos namų negu senųjų tai realiai yra miesto pakraštys tad susisiekimas viešuoju transportu gali atrodyti kiek ribotas bet jeigu nerūpi centras šis rajonas naujas jame yra daug viskių verslų darba rasti jame neturėtų būti sunku taip pat reikalingų paslaugų gausu apie kitus rajonus karoliniškės prieš kokius tris metus dirbau tame rajone susidarė įspūdis kad ten mažai kas rūpinasi aplinka galo daug pensininkų geras susisiekimas bet pėstute namo negrįžčiau tiesiog perdidelis narbuto kalnas ypač kuo arčiau narbuto gatvės šeškinė yra viskas labai vidutiniška susisiekimas yra bet kaip karoliniškėmis kalnas vienintelis dalykas kodėl nerekuomenduoju šeškinės kainos didensės negu sakykime žirmūnuose panašiau naujamiesčio kainas bet toli gražu nėra taip arti miesto centro naujininkai sako kad ten reikia turėti ekstremalo savyje turėti bet yra tekę ten vaikščioti tose vietose toliau nuo dzūkų maximos nėra taip jau blogai kainos kiek mažesnės negu kituose rajonuose aplink centrą tiesa namai gerosiose vietose yra senesni kuriuose šildymo kainos didesnės užupis žvėrynas labai nedaug daugiaaukščių žvėrynas panašus žaliakalnį jame aplink labai daug ambasadų vilngio parkas labai gražu patogu bet sąlyginai brangu užupis taip pat gražu patogu sąlyginai brangu markučiai nuosavi namai arba bendrabučiai vienareikšmiškai nėra baisu tačiau niekažką lazdynai rajonas miške ant kalno jeigu atvirai tai nelabai žinau tik tiek kad namai blokiniai \ grįžusi turėsiu deklaruoti seniūnijoje kad gyvenu lietuvoje turiu tai daryti priklausomai nuo vietos kurioje gyvensiu galiu pradžioje prisiregistruoti kaune vėliau tai keisti pagal nuomojamą vietą vilniuje \ darbo birža visiškai nieko apie tai nenusimanau žinau tik tai kad jei grįžusi prisiregistruočiau būtų apmokėtas mano privalomas sveikatos draudimas iki kol rasčiau darbą prašau apšvieskite mane jei taip supratau kai tik deklaruosi grįžimą gyvenamąją vietą deklaruosi čia turėsi pasirodyti veiki tuomet galima stoti darbo biržą jeigu darbo iškart nesiseks rasti darbo birža veikia maždaug taip jeigu nedirbi jie moka sveikatos draudimą jeigu nedeklaruoji bedarbystę sodra atsiunčia prašymą susimokėti jeigu ignoruoji nuskaičiuoja nuo lietuvos bankuose esančios sąskaitos jeigu deklaruoji bedarbystę sodra įsipraeigoja padėti rasti darbą

thanks for doing this ama just have general question regarding lockscreen security android why the lockscreen insecure regarding quick toggles the lockdown mode good for preventing unlocked access the device but the fact that thief someone else malicious can enable airplane mode disable wifi toggle mobile data etc major issue for why can choose which toggles are available the lockscreen prevent these security issues require passcode change some not harmless ones like torch etc building from that what about option disable the power menu the lockscreen this would make harder turn off the device stolen and would further security measures imagine that the common thief would aware turning off the device but may unaware about the ability hold down the power button for longer time without the power menu that window could prove crucial for location wiping the device mean can ask google assistant question without unlocking but can freely shut down toggle device settings ,1

such intolerance not new back the 90s when was high school were visiting small town tamil nadu and out shopping with some friends and made funny comment reference jayalalitha shop and was immediately told hush our hosts and once reached home was told that you shouldn say negative things about any politician public because their supporters are mostly goons who would cause problems having grown big city and school where regularly talked about current affairs and the first few minutes the school day were spent discussing the days top news stories was complete shock that you could get into trouble for merely speaking out and then ended moving tamil nadu for college and learnt that you should careful about criticising any tamil movies either you risked running into some violent fans the actors was happy move out there and have not have been the kind social circles where don have worry about speaking mind over the last few years social media has changed all that first started with iac and aap questioning anything about anna hazare and his lokpal was primarily met with name calling once aap came around got worse and then the 2014 campaign started and things just went rapidly downhill during the same period year period our cities have grown rapidly due immigration from smaller towns and villages and internet access which was mostly limited the urban elite became affordable the common man and this kind polarised say anything against favorite leader actor etc and round gang thugs and rough you scenario what most those people grew and for them this par for the course for political discourse and even though they have just found new medium express their views the way they remains the same the moderates will always just fly under the radar and avoid engaging with such elements look the bihar verdict bjp propaganda and their fanbois propagating would have you believe that modi and his plan the only way forward and anyone even questioning anti national and even the exit polls seemed endorse the view that this view was resonating with the population because only people already vocal about their views would readily submit any exit poll but the final results clearly showed that they were all wrong and the majority don care about this brand politics propaganda also there eleanor rooselvent quote great minds discuss ideas average minds discuss events small minds discuss people when have such large chunk the population that barely literate and education system that penalises independent thought you cannot expect have any kind normal debate policies plans with the average indian who raised never question authority status quo but they are definitely smart enough discuss events and how impacts them and react accordingly ,1

 going churlish and ahead and puncture your baloon one pointby one point certain that turnout this election result whole india against corruption movement even people who gave their votes bjp congress must have awakened aap some way turn out 2013 assembly elections highest ever assembly election history turn out rajasthan 2013 assembly elections highest ever state history 2013 turn out karnataka 2013 2013 despite what you might think voter turn out and interest politics amongst the young the middle class and the hitherto not interested educated masses not aap doing sure the iac movement anna hazare movement did raise lot eyeballs did the protests for nirbhaya but aap did jacksquat outside delhi heck fail get why you folks don understand core issue aap will non existent outside the ncr and maybe punjab they are non entity the south and west even the cities and the hinterland where some our population resides they are absolutely unknown but lets face aap much better opposition than inc for bjp absolutey not let paraphrase person you must dislike lot modi arnab interview said stuff said the heat the election campaign momentary run nation need the assistance every single party every single politics involves the art give and take negotiation and even the shitty congress stood firmly behind the nda when came pokhran 814 the flight kandahar the nda backed the congress some bills aap will not that they are immature and think any give and take the sign corruption and collusion aap will make for shitty opposition shittier ruling party and maybe fit only dharnas and make wild allegations none which will ever taken forward proven like the discoms ambani swiss bank accounts the hundred other baseless allegations they have made winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents most knew time has came for congress either change die forever aap has risen become worthy opponent don believe these poll results for aap just ridiculous that even after delhi mistake they under estimate aap wrong electoral politics only winning counts and what this ridicuolous logic you guys have convinced yourself about the congress not dying did not die did not die 2004 will still the second largest party will still rule odd major states this country will still command minimum vote share nationally can summon allies deadlock parliament needs has money has power has connections has pull the media you think congress dying you are absolutely wrong wait for aap shatter over the next years that bound happen but congress will remain wouldn even surprised pappu mrs vadra came power either 2019 2024 the least upa coming back power aap supporters are naive leaders when comes real politik atleast the way leaders potray themselves also delhi 2013 not the rest india heck delhi 2014 not delhi 2013 mark words again this aap will the second largest party with about seats the delhi assembly 2014 for jlp they will end losing everything state centre and goodwill the people thinking about this scenario with eye future see bad times why party getting much ridiculed for cleaning politics what load rubbish what cleaning parties aap did the following subsidy raj hooliganism only smaller reach they are smaller party endless political drama the cost governance what the difference between mamta not doing anything bengal and claiming moist conspiracy and ak49 doing nothing and claiming the bjp ambani hand behind their absolute non performance associating with absolute communal muslims like taufeeq raza guy who ordered taslima beheaded jamiat islami hind the name being secular aap saar the exact replica the congress bsp tmc they have huge corruption scams their name yet did tmc have the taint scams till took power give time the average aap neta will also very similar the average political goon why you people have forgotten inc they are responsible that are where were yrs back like that india will not like where maya and mulayam romance people alternately lmao truly lmao aap forgot inc real life where ak49 has not mentioned the name rajmata her brood even once publicly except when last minute added her name his list corrupt even these forums which amount nothing irl have seen this behaviour aap aap leaders and followers who skewed the debate away from inc and failures into making some mission stop one man who the least corrupt big margin amongst leaders india today anything aap had virulently campaigned amongst support base small group educated urban indians against the inc the approx vote share would have also come the bjp and might have resulted lesser seats the inc and maybe maybe truly weakend that party but nope you guys had skew the debate away from your handlers ak49 janpath agree wholeheartedly with you the rest your post about keeping clean clarify this post not addressed you individually but the larger superset aap followers here mean offense you and post has hurt you any way please accept apologies lastly still think the exit polls are absolutely horrendously over bloated towards the nda and the nda crowning not certain and aap feel will get seats and not back empty handed fingers crossed ninja edit typos spelling mistakes etc long post didn truly clean all that said surprised you left out bjp and modi efforts rallying the masses that man accomplished some herculean stuff according the latest india today report has directly participated some 500 speeches been part holograms chai charcha etc some 000 has travelled some 000 and apparently met reached out the total bloody electorate you might dislike him you might hate him but you might want respect him his professionalism single minded focus and absolute bloodymindedness the face opposition from almost all other parties across india and about the sucession plans premature though they may the bjp for all the faults non bjp supporters find with truly democratic meritocratic party and the distant future get parikkar chouhan would say

here interesting fact india had free healthcare before insurance companies made appearance the 90s the government hospitals were all free people had wait for serious procedures though and private hospital services were priced reasonably middle class person could walk into private hospital and come out without being bankrupt because the hospitals knew how much the market can afford now years later cost healthcare has gone and not indicative what the market can afford but more indication how much insurance companies can charged private hospitals neglect people who don’ have insurance has become like the for the patient pain have fight every claim with insurance companies ,1
